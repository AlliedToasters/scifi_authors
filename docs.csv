    Red and Slim found the two strange little animals the morning after
    they heard the thunder sounds. They knew that they could never show
    their new pets to their parents.


[Illustration]


There was a spatter of pebbles against the window and the youngster
stirred in his sleep. Another, and he was awake.

He sat up stiffly in bed. Seconds passed while he interpreted his
strange surroundings. He wasn't in his own home, of course. This was out
in the country. It was colder than it should be and there was green at
the window.

""Slim!""

The call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster bounded to the
open window.

Slim wasn't his real name, but the new friend he had met the day before
had needed only one look at his slight figure to say, ""You're Slim."" He
added, ""I'm Red.""

Red wasn't his real name, either, but its appropriateness was obvious.
They were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship of
young ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even the first stains of
adulthood began to make their appearance.

Slim cried, ""Hi, Red!"" and waved cheerfully, still blinking the sleep
out of himself.

Red kept to his croaking whisper, ""Quiet! You want to wake somebody?""

Slim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in
the east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that the grass was
wet.

Slim said, more softly, ""What's the matter?""

Red only waved for him to come out.

Slim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary
sprinkle of a little lukewarm water. He let the air dry the exposed
portions of his body as he ran out, while bare skin grew wet against the
dewy grass.

Red said, ""You've got to be quiet. If Mom wakes up or Dad or your Dad or
even any of the hands then it'll be 'Come on in or you'll catch your
death of cold.'""

He mimicked voice and tone faithfully, so that Slim laughed and thought
that there had never been so funny a fellow as Red.

Slim said, eagerly, ""Do you come out here every day like this, Red? Real
early? It's like the whole world is just yours, isn't it, Red? No one
else around and all like that."" He felt proud at being allowed entrance
into this private world.

Red stared at him sidelong. He said carelessly, ""I've been up for hours.
Didn't you hear it last night?""

""Hear what?""

""Thunder.""

""Was there a thunderstorm?"" Slim never slept through a thunderstorm.

""I guess not. But there was thunder. I heard it, and then I went to the
window and it wasn't raining. It was all stars and the sky was just
getting sort of almost gray. You know what I mean?""

Slim had never seen it so, but he nodded.

""So I just thought I'd go out,"" said Red.

They walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split the
panorama right down the middle all the way down to where it vanished
among the hills. It was so old that Red's father couldn't tell Red when
it had been built. It didn't have a crack or a rough spot in it.

Red said, ""Can you keep a secret?""

""Sure, Red. What kind of a secret?""

""Just a secret. Maybe I'll tell you and maybe I won't. I don't know
yet."" Red broke a long, supple stem from a fern they passed,
methodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left
whip-fashion. For a moment, he was on a wild charger, which reared and
champed under his iron control. Then he got tired, tossed the whip aside
and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future
use.

He said, ""There'll be a circus around.""

Slim said, ""That's no secret. I knew that. My Dad told me even before we
came here--""

""That's not the secret. Fine secret! Ever see a circus?""

""Oh, sure. You bet.""

""Like it?""

""Say, there isn't anything I like better.""

Red was watching out of the corner of his eyes again. ""Ever think you
would like to be with a circus? I mean, for good?""

Slim considered, ""I guess not. I think I'll be an astronomer like my
Dad. I think he wants me to be.""

""Huh! Astronomer!"" said Red.

Slim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and
astronomy became a thing of dead stars and black, empty space.

He said, placatingly, ""A circus _would_ be more fun.""

""You're just saying that.""

""No, I'm not. I mean it.""

Red grew argumentative. ""Suppose you had a chance to join the circus
right now. What would you do?""

""I--I--""

""See!"" Red affected scornful laughter.

Slim was stung. ""I'd join up.""

""Go on.""

""Try me.""

Red whirled at him, strange and intense. ""You meant that? You want to go
in with me?""

[Illustration]

""What do you mean?"" Slim stepped back a bit, surprised by the unexpected
challenge.

""I got something that can get us into the circus. Maybe someday we can
even have a circus of our own. We could be the biggest circus-fellows in
the world. That's if you want to go in with me. Otherwise--Well, I guess
I can do it on my own. I just thought: Let's give good old Slim a
chance.""

The world was strange and glamorous, and Slim said, ""Sure thing, Red.
I'm in! What is it, huh, Red? Tell me what it is.""

""Figure it out. What's the most important thing in circuses?""

Slim thought desperately. He wanted to give the right answer. Finally,
he said, ""Acrobats?""

""Holy Smokes! I wouldn't go five steps to look at acrobats.""

""I don't know then.""

""Animals, that's what! What's the best side-show? Where are the biggest
crowds? Even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts."" There was
no doubt in Red's voice.

""Do you think so?""

""Everyone thinks so. You ask anyone. Anyway, I found animals this
morning. Two of them.""

""And you've got them?""

""Sure. That's the secret. Are you telling?""

""Of course not.""

""Okay. I've got them in the barn. Do you want to see them?""

They were almost at the barn; its huge open door black. Too black. They
had been heading there all the time. Slim stopped in his tracks.

He tried to make his words casual. ""Are they big?""

""Would I fool with them if they were big? They can't hurt you. They're
only about so long. I've got them in a cage.""

They were in the barn now and Slim saw the large cage suspended from a
hook in the roof. It was covered with stiff canvas.

Red said, ""We used to have some bird there or something. Anyway, they
can't get away from there. Come on, let's go up to the loft.""

They clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them.

Slim pointed and said, ""There's sort of a hole in the canvas.""

Red frowned. ""How'd that get there?"" He lifted the canvas, looked in,
and said, with relief, ""They're still there.""

""The canvas appeared to be burned,"" worried Slim.

""You want to look, or don't you?""

Slim nodded slowly. He wasn't sure he wanted to, after all. They might
be--

But the canvas had been jerked off and there they were. Two of them, the
way Red said. They were small, and sort of disgusting-looking. The
animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward
the youngsters. Red poked a cautious finger at them.

""Watch out,"" said Slim, in agony.

""They don't hurt you,"" said Red. ""Ever see anything like them?""

""No.""

""Can't you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these?""

""Maybe they're too small for a circus.""

Red looked annoyed. He let go the cage which swung back and forth
pendulum-fashion. ""You're just trying to back out, aren't you?""

""No, I'm not. It's just--""

""They're not too small, don't worry. Right now, I've only got one
worry.""

""What's that?""

""Well, I've got to keep them till the circus comes, don't I? I've got
to figure out what to feed them meanwhile.""

The cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars,
gesturing at the youngsters with queer, quick motions--almost as though
they were intelligent.

",youth,asimov,1952,1,1396
"
The Astronomer entered the dining room with decorum. He felt very much
the guest.

He said, ""Where are the youngsters? My son isn't in his room.""

The Industrialist smiled. ""They've been out for hours. However,
breakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago, so there
is nothing to worry about. Youth, Doctor, youth!""

""Youth!"" The word seemed to depress the Astronomer.

They ate breakfast in silence. The Industrialist said once, ""You really
think they'll come. The day looks so--_normal_.""

The Astronomer said, ""They'll come.""

That was all.

Afterward the Industrialist said, ""You'll pardon me. I can't conceive
your playing so elaborate a hoax. You really spoke to them?""

""As I speak to you. At least, in a sense. They can project thoughts.""

""I gathered that must be so from your letter. How, I wonder.""

""I could not say. I asked them and, of course, they were vague. Or
perhaps it was just that I could not understand. It involves a projector
for the focussing of thought and, even more than that, conscious
attention on the part of both projector and receptor. It was quite a
while before I realized they were trying to think at me. Such
thought-projectors may be part of the science they will give us.""

""Perhaps,"" said the Industrialist. ""Yet think of the changes it would
bring to society. A thought-projector!""

""Why not? Change would be good for us.""

""I don't think so.""

""It is only in old age that change is unwelcome,"" said the Astronomer,
""and races can be old as well as individuals.""

The Industrialist pointed out the window. ""You see that road. It was
built Beforethewars. I don't know exactly when. It is as good now as the
day it was built. We couldn't possibly duplicate it now. The race was
young when that was built, eh?""

""Then? Yes! At least they weren't afraid of new things.""

""No. I wish they had been. Where is the society of Beforethewars?
Destroyed, Doctor! What good were youth and new things? We are better
off now. The world is peaceful and jogs along. The race goes nowhere but
after all, there is nowhere to go. _They_ proved that. The men who built
the road. I will speak with your visitors as I agreed, if they come. But
I think I will only ask them to go.""

""The race is not going nowhere,"" said the Astronomer, earnestly. ""It is
going toward final destruction. My university has a smaller student body
each year. Fewer books are written. Less work is done. An old man sleeps
in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging, but each day finds
him nearer death all the same.""

""Well, well,"" said the Industrialist.

""No, don't dismiss it. Listen. Before I wrote you, I investigated your
position in the planetary economy.""

""And you found me solvent?"" interrupted the Industrialist, smiling.

""Why, yes. Oh, I see, you are joking. And yet--perhaps the joke is not
far off. You are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent
than his father. Perhaps your son will no longer be solvent. It becomes
too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still
exist, though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of Beforethewars. We
will be back to village economy and then to what? The caves?""

""And the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing
of all that?""

""Not just the new knowledge. Rather the whole effect of change, of a
broadening of horizons. Look, sir, I chose you to approach in this
matter not only because you were rich and influential with government
officials, but because you had an unusual reputation, for these days, of
daring to break with tradition. Our people will resist change and you
would know how to handle them, how to see to it that--that--""

""That the youth of the race is revived?""

""Yes.""

""With its atomic bombs?""

""The atomic bombs,"" returned the Astronomer, ""need not be the end of
civilization. These visitors of mine had their atomic bomb, or whatever
their equivalent was on their own worlds, and survived it, because they
didn't give up. Don't you see? It wasn't the bomb that defeated us, but
our own shell shock. This may be the last chance to reverse the
process.""

[Illustration]

""Tell me,"" said the Industrialist, ""what do these friends from space
want in return?""

The Astronomer hesitated. He said, ""I will be truthful with you. They
come from a denser planet. Ours is richer in the lighter atoms.""

""They want magnesium? Aluminum?""

""No, sir. Carbon and hydrogen. They want coal and oil.""

""Really?""

The Astronomer said, quickly, ""You are going to ask why creatures who
have mastered space travel, and therefore atomic power, would want coal
and oil. I can't answer that.""

The Industrialist smiled. ""But I can. This is the best evidence yet of
the truth of your story. Superficially, atomic power would seem to
preclude the use of coal and oil. However, quite apart from the energy
gained by their combustion they remain, and always will remain, the
basic raw material for all organic chemistry. Plastics, dyes,
pharmaceuticals, solvents. Industry could not exist without them, even
in an atomic age. Still, if coal and oil are the low price for which
they would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth, my answer
is that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis.""

The Astronomer sighed and said, ""There are the boys!""

They were visible through the open window, standing together in the
grassy field and lost in animated conversation. The Industrialist's son
pointed imperiously and the Astronomer's son nodded and made off at a
run toward the house.

The Industrialist said, ""There is the Youth you speak of. Our race has
as much of it as it ever had.""

""Yes, but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold.""

Slim scuttled into the room, the door banging behind him.

The Astronomer said, in mild disapproval, ""What's this?""

Slim looked up in surprise and came to a halt. ""I beg your pardon. I
didn't know anyone was here. I am sorry to have interrupted."" His
enunciation was almost painfully precise.

The Industrialist said, ""It's all right, youngster.""

But the Astronomer said, ""Even if you had been entering an empty room,
son, there would be no cause for slamming a door.""

""Nonsense,"" insisted the Industrialist. ""The youngster has done no harm.
You simply scold him for being young. You, with your views!""

He said to Slim, ""Come here, lad.""

Slim advanced slowly.

""How do you like the country, eh?""

""Very much, sir, thank you.""

""My son has been showing you about the place, has he?""

""Yes, sir. Red--I mean--""

""No, no. Call him Red. I call him that myself. Now tell me, what are you
two up to, eh?""

Slim looked away. ""Why--just exploring, sir.""

The Industrialist turned to the Astronomer. ""There you are, youthful
curiosity and adventure-lust. The race has not yet lost it.""

Slim said, ""Sir?""

""Yes, lad.""

The youngster took a long time in getting on with it. He said, ""Red sent
me in for something good to eat, but I don't exactly know what he meant.
I didn't like to say so.""

""Why, just ask cook. She'll have something good for young'uns to eat.""

""Oh, no, sir. I mean for animals.""

""For animals?""

""Yes, sir. What do animals eat?""

The Astronomer said, ""I am afraid my son is city-bred.""

""Well,"" said the Industrialist, ""there's no harm in that. What kind of
an animal, lad?""

""A small one, sir.""

""Then try grass or leaves, and if they don't want that, nuts or berries
would probably do the trick.""

""Thank you, sir."" Slim ran out again, closing the door gently behind
him.

The Astronomer said, ""Do you suppose they've trapped an animal alive?""
He was obviously perturbed.

""That's common enough. There's no shooting on my estate and it's tame
country, full of rodents and small creatures. Red is always coming home
with pets of one sort or another. They rarely maintain his interest for
long.""

He looked at the wall clock. ""Your friends should have been here by now,
shouldn't they?""

",youth,asimov,1952,1,1367
"
The swaying had come to a halt and it was dark. The Explorer was not
comfortable in the alien air. It felt as thick as soup and he had to
breathe shallowly. Even so--

He reached out in a sudden need for company. The Merchant was warm to
the touch. His breathing was rough, he moved in an occasional spasm, and
was obviously asleep. The Explorer hesitated and decided not to wake
him. It would serve no real purpose.

There would be no rescue, of course. That was the penalty paid for the
high profits which unrestrained competition could lead to. The Merchant
who opened a new planet could have a ten year monopoly of its trade,
which he might hug to himself or, more likely, rent out to all comers at
a stiff price. It followed that planets were searched for in secrecy
and, preferably, away from the usual trade routes. In a case such as
theirs, then, there was little or no chance that another ship would come
within range of their subetherics except for the most improbable of
coincidences. Even if they were in their ship, that is, rather than in
this--this--_cage_.

The Explorer grasped the thick bars. Even if they blasted those away, as
they could, they would be stuck too high in open air for leaping.

It was too bad. They had landed twice before in the scout-ship. They had
established contact with the natives who were grotesquely huge, but mild
and unaggressive. It was obvious that they had once owned a flourishing
technology, but hadn't faced up to the consequences of such a
technology. It would have been a wonderful market.

And it was a tremendous world. The Merchant, especially, had been taken
aback. He had known the figures that expressed the planet's diameter,
but from a distance of two light-seconds, he had stood at the visi-plate
and muttered, ""Unbelievable!""

""Oh, there are larger worlds,"" the Explorer said. It wouldn't do for an
Explorer to be too easily impressed.

""Inhabited?""

""Well, no.""

""Why, you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it.""

The Explorer smiled. It was a gentle dig at his Arcturian homeland,
which was smaller than most planets. He said, ""Not quite.""

The Merchant followed along the line of his thoughts. ""And the
inhabitants are large in proportion to their world?"" He sounded as
though the news struck him less favorably now.

""Nearly ten times our height.""

""Are you sure they are friendly?""

""That is hard to say. Friendship between alien intelligences is an
imponderable. They are not dangerous, I think. We've come across other
groups that could not maintain equilibrium after the atomic war stage
and you know the results. Introversion. Retreat. Gradual decadence and
increasing gentleness.""

""Even if they are such monsters?""

""The principle remains.""

It was about then that the Explorer felt the heavy throbbing of the
engines.

He frowned and said, ""We are descending a bit too quickly.""

There had been some speculation on the dangers of landing some hours
before. The planetary target was a huge one for an oxygen-water world.
Though it lacked the size of the uninhabitable hydrogen-ammonia planets
and its low density made its surface gravity fairly normal, its
gravitational forces fell off but slowly with distance. In short, its
gravitational potential was high and the ship's Calculator was a
run-of-the-mill model not designed to plot landing trajectories at that
potential range. That meant the Pilot would have to use manual controls.

It would have been wiser to install a more high-powered model, but that
would have meant a trip to some outpost of civilization; lost time;
perhaps a lost secret. The Merchant demanded an immediate landing.

The Merchant felt it necessary to defend his position now. He said
angrily to the Explorer, ""Don't you think the Pilot knows his job? He
landed you safely twice before.""

Yes, thought the Explorer, in a scout-ship, not in this unmaneuverable
freighter. Aloud, he said nothing.

He kept his eye on the visi-plate. They were descending too quickly.
There was no room for doubt. Much too quickly.

The Merchant said, peevishly, ""Why do you keep silence?""

""Well, then, if you wish me to speak, I would suggest that you strap on
your Floater and help me prepare the Ejector.""

The Pilot fought a noble fight. He was no beginner. The atmosphere,
abnormally high and thick in the gravitational potential of this world
whipped and burned about the ship, but to the very last it looked as
though he might bring it under control despite that.

He even maintained course, following the extrapolated line to the point
on the northern continent toward which they were headed. Under other
circumstances, with a shade more luck, the story would eventually have
been told and retold as a heroic and masterly reversal of a lost
situation. But within sight of victory, tired body and tired nerves
clamped a control bar with a shade too much pressure. The ship, which
had almost levelled off, dipped down again.

There was no room to retrieve the final error. There was only a mile
left to fall. The Pilot remained at his post to the actual landing, his
only thought that of breaking the force of the crash, of maintaining the
spaceworthiness of the vessel. He did not survive. With the ship bucking
madly in a soupy atmosphere, few Ejectors could be mobilized and only
one of them in time.

When afterwards, the Explorer lifted out of unconsciousness and rose
to his feet, he had the definite feeling that but for himself and
the Merchant, there were no survivors. And perhaps that was an
over-calculation. His Floater had burnt out while still sufficiently
distant from surface to have the fall stun him. The Merchant might have
had less luck, even, than that.

He was surrounded by a world of thick, ropy stalks of grass, and in the
distance were trees that reminded him vaguely of similar structures on
his native Arcturian world except that their lowest branches were high
above what he would consider normal tree-tops.

He called, his voice sounding basso in the thick air and the Merchant
answered. The Explorer made his way toward him, thrusting violently at
the coarse stalks that barred his path.

""Are you hurt?"" he asked.

The Merchant grimaced. ""I've sprained something. It hurts to walk.""

The Explorer probed gently. ""I don't think anything is broken. You'll
have to walk despite the pain.""

""Can't we rest first?""

""It's important to try to find the ship. If it is spaceworthy or if it
can be repaired, we may live. Otherwise, we won't.""

""Just a few minutes. Let me catch my breath.""

The Explorer was glad enough for those few minutes. The Merchant's eyes
were already closed. He allowed his to do the same.

He heard the trampling and his eyes snapped open. Never sleep on a
strange planet, he told himself futilely.
",youth,asimov,1952,1,1155
"
The Merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of
terror.

The Explorer called, ""It's only a native of this planet. It won't harm
you.""

But even as he spoke, the giant had swooped down and in a moment they
were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness.

The Merchant struggled violently and, of course, quite futilely. ""Can't
you talk to it?"" he yelled.

The Explorer could only shake his head. ""I can't reach it with the
Projector. It won't be listening.""

""Then blast it. Blast it down.""

""We can't do that."" The phrase ""you fool"" had almost been added. The
Explorer struggled to keep his self-control. They were swallowing space
as the monster moved purposefully away.

""Why not?"" cried the Merchant. ""You can reach your blaster. I see it in
plain sight. Don't be afraid of falling.""

""It's simpler than that. If this monster is killed, you'll never trade
with this planet. You'll never even leave it. You probably won't live
the day out.""

""Why? Why?""

""Because this is one of the young of the species. You should know what
happens when a trader kills a native young, even accidentally. What's
more, if this is the target-point, then we are on the estate of a
powerful native. This might be one of his brood.""

That was how they entered their present prison. They had carefully burnt
away a portion of the thick, stiff covering and it was obvious that the
height from which they were suspended was a killing one.

Now, once again, the prison-cage shuddered and lifted in an upward arc.
The Merchant rolled to the lower rim and startled awake. The cover
lifted and light flooded in. As was the case the time before, there were
two specimens of the young. They were not very different in appearance
from adults of the species, reflected the Explorer, though, of course,
they were considerably smaller.

A handful of reedy green stalks was stuffed between the bars. Its odor
was not unpleasant but it carried clods of soil at its ends.

The Merchant drew away and said, huskily, ""What are they doing?""

The Explorer said, ""Trying to feed us, I should judge. At least this
seems to be the native equivalent of grass.""

The cover was replaced and they were set swinging again, alone with
their fodder.


Slim started at the sound of footsteps and brightened when it turned out
to be only Red.

He said, ""No one's around. I had my eye peeled, you bet.""

Red said, ""Ssh. Look. You take this stuff and stick it in the cage. I've
got to scoot back to the house.""

""What is it?"" Slim reached reluctantly.

""Ground meat. Holy Smokes, haven't you ever seen ground meat? That's
what you should've got when I sent you to the house instead of coming
back with that stupid grass.""

Slim was hurt. ""How'd I know they don't eat grass. Besides, ground meat
doesn't come loose like that. It comes in cellophane and it isn't that
color.""

""Sure--in the city. Out here we grind our own and it's always this color
till it's cooked.""

""You mean it isn't cooked?"" Slim drew away quickly.

Red looked disgusted. ""Do you think animals eat _cooked_ food. Come on,
take it. It won't hurt you. I tell you there isn't much time.""

""Why? What's doing back at the house?""

""I don't know. Dad and your father are walking around. I think maybe
they're looking for me. Maybe the cook told them I took the meat.
Anyway, we don't want them coming here after me.""

""Didn't you ask the cook before you took this stuff?""

""Who? That crab? Shouldn't wonder if she only let me have a drink of
water because Dad makes her. Come on. Take it.""

Slim took the large glob of meat though his skin crawled at the touch.
He turned toward the barn and Red sped away in the direction from which
he had come.

He slowed when he approached the two adults, took a few deep breaths to
bring himself back to normal, and then carefully and nonchalantly
sauntered past. (They were walking in the general direction of the barn,
he noticed, but not dead on.)

He said, ""Hi, Dad. Hello, sir.""

The Industrialist said, ""Just a moment, Red. I have a question to ask
you?""

Red turned a carefully blank face to his father. ""Yes, Dad?""

""Mother tells me you were out early this morning.""

""Not real early, Dad. Just a little before breakfast.""

""She said you told her it was because you had been awakened during the
night and didn't go back to sleep.""

Red waited before answering. Should he have told Mom that?

Then he said, ""Yes, sir.""

""What was it that awakened you?""

Red saw no harm in it. He said, ""I don't know, Dad. It sounded like
thunder, sort of, and like a collision, sort of.""

""Could you tell where it came from?""

""It _sounded_ like it was out by the hill."" That was truthful, and
useful as well, since the direction was almost opposite that in which
the barn lay.

The Industrialist looked at his guest. ""I suppose it would do no harm to
walk toward the hill.""

The Astronomer said, ""I am ready.""

Red watched them walk away and when he turned he saw Slim peering
cautiously out from among the briars of a hedge.

Red waved at him. ""Come on.""

Slim stepped out and approached. ""Did they say anything about the meat?""

""No. I guess they don't know about that. They went down to the hill.""

""What for?""

""Search me. They kept asking about the noise I heard. Listen, did the
animals eat the meat?""

""Well,"" said Slim, cautiously, ""they were sort of _looking_ at it and
smelling it or something.""

""Okay,"" Red said, ""I guess they'll eat it. Holy Smokes, they've got to
eat _something_. Let's walk along toward the hill and see what Dad and
your father are going to do.""

""What about the animals?""

""They'll be all right. A fellow can't spend all his time on them. Did
you give them water?""

""Sure. They drank that.""

""See. Come on. We'll look at them after lunch. I tell you what. We'll
bring them fruit. Anything'll eat fruit.""

Together they trotted up the rise, Red, as usual, in the lead.

",youth,asimov,1952,1,1059
"
The Astronomer said, ""You think the noise was their ship landing?""

""Don't you think it could be?""

""If it were, they may all be dead.""

""Perhaps not."" The Industrialist frowned.

""If they have landed, and are still alive, where are they?""

""Think about that for a while."" He was still frowning.

The Astronomer said, ""I don't understand you.""

""They may not be friendly.""

""Oh, no. I've spoken with them. They've--""

""You've spoken with them. Call that reconnaissance. What would their
next step be? Invasion?""

""But they only have one ship, sir.""

""You know that only because they say so. They might have a fleet.""

""I've told you about their size. They--""

""Their size would not matter, if they have handweapons that may well be
superior to our artillery.""

""That is not what I meant.""

""I had this partly in mind from the first."" The Industrialist went on.
""It is for that reason I agreed to see them after I received your
letter. Not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade, but to judge
their real purposes. I did not count on their evading the meeting.""

He sighed. ""I suppose it isn't our fault. You are right in one thing, at
any rate. The world has been at peace too long. We are losing a healthy
sense of suspicion.""

The Astronomer's mild voice rose to an unusual pitch and he said, ""I
_will_ speak. I tell you that there is no reason to suppose they can
possibly be hostile. They are small, yes, but that is only important
because it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds are
small. Our world has what is for them a normal gravity, but because of
our much higher gravitational potential, our atmosphere is too dense to
support them comfortably over sustained periods. For a similar reason
the use of the world as a base for interstellar travel, except for trade
in certain items, is uneconomical. And there are important differences
in chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils. They
couldn't eat our food or we theirs.""

""Surely all this can be overcome. They can bring their own food, build
domed stations of lowered air pressure, devise specially designed
ships.""

""They can. And how glibly you can describe feats that are easy to a race
in its youth. It is simply that they don't have to do any of that. There
are millions of worlds suitable for them in the Galaxy. They don't need
this one which isn't.""

""How do you know? All this is their information again.""

""This I was able to check independently. I am an astronomer, after all.""

""That is true. Let me hear what you have to say then, while we walk.""

""Then, sir, consider that for a long time our astronomers have believed
that two general classes of planetary bodies existed. First, the planets
which formed at distances far enough from their stellar nucleus to
become cool enough to capture hydrogen. These would be large planets
rich in hydrogen, ammonia and methane. We have examples of these in the
giant outer planets. The second class would include those planets formed
so near the stellar center that the high temperature would make it
impossible to capture much hydrogen. These would be smaller planets,
comparatively poorer in hydrogen and richer in oxygen. We know that type
very well since we live on one. Ours is the only solar system we know in
detail, however, and it has been reasonable for us to assume that these
were the _only_ two planetary classes.""

""I take it then that there is another.""

""Yes. There is a super-dense class, still smaller, poorer in hydrogen,
than the inner planets of the solar system. The ratio of occurrence of
hydrogen-ammonia planets and these super-dense water-oxygen worlds of
theirs over the entire Galaxy--and remember that they have actually
conducted a survey of significant sample volumes of the Galaxy which we,
without interstellar travel, cannot do--is about 3 to 1. This leaves
them seven million super-dense worlds for exploration and colonization.""

The Industrialist looked at the blue sky and the green-covered trees
among which they were making their way. He said, ""And worlds like ours?""

The Astronomer said, softly, ""Ours is the first solar system they have
found which contains them. Apparently the development of our solar
system was unique and did not follow the ordinary rules.""

The Industrialist considered that. ""What it amounts to is that these
creatures from space are asteroid-dwellers.""

""No, no. The asteroids are something else again. They occur, I was told,
in one out of eight stellar systems, but they're completely different
from what we've been discussing.""

""And how does your being an astronomer change the fact that you are
still only quoting their unsupported statements?""

""But they did not restrict themselves to bald items of information. They
presented me with a theory of stellar evolution which I had to accept
and which is more nearly valid than anything our own astronomy has ever
been able to devise, if we except possible lost theories dating from
Beforethewars. Mind you, their theory had a rigidly mathematical
development and it predicted just such a Galaxy as they describe. So you
see, they have all the worlds they wish. They are not land-hungry.
Certainly not for our land.""

""Reason would say so, if what you say is true. But creatures may be
intelligent and not reasonable. Our forefathers were presumably
intelligent, yet they were certainly not reasonable. Was it reasonable
to destroy almost all their tremendous civilization in atomic warfare
over causes our historians can no longer accurately determine?"" The
Industrialist brooded over it. ""From the dropping of the first atom bomb
over those islands--I forget the ancient name--there was only one end in
sight, and in plain sight. Yet events were allowed to proceed to that
end.""

He looked up, said briskly, ""Well, where are we? I wonder if we are not
on a fool's errand after all.""

But the Astronomer was a little in advance and his voice came thickly.
""No fool's errand, sir. Look there.""

New Elements

In 1934 Enrico Fermi began his first experiments involving the
bombardment of uranium with neutrons—experiments that were to change the
face of the world.

Fermi had found that slow neutrons, which had very little energy, were
easily absorbed by atomic nuclei—more easily than fast neutrons were
absorbed, and certainly more easily than charged particles were.

Often what happened was that the neutron was simply absorbed by the
nucleus. Since the neutron has a mass number of 1 and an atomic number
of 0 (because it is uncharged), a nucleus that absorbs a neutron remains
an isotope of the same element, but increases its mass number.

For instance, suppose that neutrons are used to bombard hydrogen-1,
which then captures one of the neutrons. From a single proton, it will
become a proton plus a neutron; from hydrogen-1, it will become
hydrogen-2. A new nucleus formed in this way will be at a higher energy
and that energy is emitted in the form of a gamma ray.

Sometimes the more massive isotope that is formed through neutron
absorption is stable, as hydrogen-2 is. Sometimes it is not, but is
radioactive instead. Because it has added a neutron, it has too many
neutrons for stability. The best way of adjusting the matter is to emit
a beta particle (electron). This converts one of the neutrons into a
proton. The mass number stays the same but the atomic number increases
by one.

The element rhodium, for example, which has an atomic number of 45, has
only 1 stable isotope, with a mass number of 103. If rhodium-103 (45
protons, 58 neutrons) absorbs a neutron, it becomes rhodium-104 (45
protons, 59 neutrons), which is not stable. Rhodium-104 emits a beta
particle, changing a neutron to a proton so that the nuclear combination
becomes 46 protons and 58 neutrons. This is palladium-104, which is
stable.

[Illustration: _Fermi’s laboratory in Rome in 1930._]

As another example, indium-115 (49 protons, 66 neutrons) absorbs a
neutron and becomes indium-116 (49 protons, 67 neutrons), which gives
off a beta particle and becomes tin-116 (50 protons, 66 neutrons), which
is stable.

There are over 100 isotopes that will absorb neutrons and end by
becoming an isotope of an element one higher in the atomic number scale.
Fermi observed a number of these cases.

Having done so, he was bound to ask what would happen if uranium were
bombarded with neutrons. Would its isotopes also be raised in atomic
number—in this case from 92 to 93? If that were so it would be very
exciting, for uranium had the highest atomic number in the entire scale.
Nobody had ever discovered any sample of element number 93, but perhaps
it could be formed in the laboratory.

In 1934, therefore, Fermi bombarded uranium with neutrons in the hope of
obtaining atoms of element 93. Neutrons were absorbed and whatever was
formed did give off beta particles, so element 93 should be there.
However, four different kinds of beta particles (different in their
energy content) were given off and the matter grew very confusing. Fermi
could not definitely identify the presence of atoms of element 93 and
neither could anyone else for several years. Other things turned up,
however, which were even more significant.

Before going on to these other things, however, it should be mentioned
that undoubtedly element 93 was formed even though Fermi couldn’t
clearly demonstrate the fact. In 1939 the American physicists Edwin
Mattison McMillan (1907-    ) and Philip Hauge Abelson (1913-    ),
after bombarding uranium atoms with slow neutrons, were able to identify
element 93. Since uranium had originally been named for the planet,
Uranus, the new element beyond uranium was eventually named for the
planet Neptune, which lay beyond Uranus. Element 93 is therefore called
“neptunium”.

[Illustration: _Otto R. Frisch_]

[Illustration: _Glenn T. Seaborg_]

[Illustration: _Philip H. Abelson_]

What happened was exactly what was expected. Uranium-238 (92 protons,
146 neutrons) added a neutron to become uranium-239 (92 protons, 147
neutrons), which emitted a beta particle to become neptunium-239 (93
protons, 146 neutrons).

In fact, neptunium-239 also emitted a beta particle so it ought to
become an isotope of an element even higher in the atomic number scale.
This one, element 94, was named “plutonium” after Pluto, the planet
beyond Neptune. The isotope, plutonium-239, formed from neptunium-239,
was only feebly radioactive, however, and it was not clearly identified
until 1941.

The actual discovery of the element plutonium came the year before,
however, when neptunium-238 was formed. It emitted a beta particle and
became plutonium-238, an isotope that was radioactive enough to be
easily detected and identified by Glenn Theodore Seaborg (1912-    ),
and his co-workers, who completed McMillan’s experiments when he was
called away to other defense research.

Neptunium and plutonium were the first “transuranium elements” to be
produced in the laboratory, but they weren’t the last. Over the next 30
years, isotopes were formed that contained more and more protons in the
nucleus and therefore had higher and higher atomic numbers. At the
moment of writing, isotopes of every element up to and including element
105 have been formed.

A number of these new elements have been named for some of the
scientists important in the history of nuclear research. Element 96 is
“curium”, named for Pierre and Marie Curie; element 99 is “einsteinium”
for Albert Einstein; and element 100 is “fermium” for Enrico Fermi.

Element 101 is “mendelevium” for the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeléev,
who early in 1869 was the first to arrange the elements in a reasonable
and useful order. Element 103 is “lawrencium” for Ernest O. Lawrence.
“Rutherfordium” for Ernest Rutherford has been proposed for element 104.

And “hahnium” for Otto Hahn (1879-1968), a German physical chemist whose
contribution we will come to shortly, has been proposed for element 105.

Neptunium, however, was not the first new element to be created in the
laboratory. In the early 1930s, there were still 2 elements with fairly
low atomic numbers that had never been discovered. These were the
elements with atomic numbers 43 and 61.

In 1937, though, molybdenum (atomic number 42) had been bombarded with
neutrons in Lawrence’s laboratory in the United States. It might contain
small quantities of element 43 as a result. The Italian physicist Emilio
Segrè (1905-    ), who had worked with Fermi, obtained a sample of the
bombarded molybdenum and indeed obtained indications of the presence of
element 43. It was the first new element to be manufactured by
artificial means and was called “technetium” from the Greek word for
“artificial”.

The technetium isotope that was formed was radioactive. Indeed, all the
technetium isotopes are radioactive. Element 61, discovered in 1945 and
named “promethium”, also has no stable isotopes. Technetium and
promethium are the only elements with atomic numbers less than 84 that
do not have even a single stable isotope.
",nuclear_energy_3,asimov,1972,0,1149
"
The Discovery of Fission

But let us get back to the bombardment of uranium with neutrons research
that Fermi had begun. After he had reported his work, other physicists
repeated it and also got a variety of beta particles and were also
unable to decide what was going on.

[Illustration: _Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in their laboratory in the
1930s._]

One way to tackle the problem was to add to the system some stable
element that was chemically similar to the tiny traces of radioactive
isotopes that might be produced through the bombardment of uranium.
Afterwards the stable element could probably be separated out of the
mixture and the trace of radioactivity would, it was hoped, be carried
along with it. The stable element would be a “carrier”.

Among those working on the problem were Otto Hahn and his Austrian
co-worker, the physicist Lise Meitner (1878-1968). Among the potential
carriers they added to the system was the element, barium, which has an
atomic number of 56. They found that a considerable quantity of the
radioactivity did indeed accompany the barium when they separated that
element out of the system.

A natural conclusion was that the isotopes producing the radioactivity
belonged to an element that was chemically very similar to barium.
Suspicion fell at once on radium (atomic number 88), which was very like
barium indeed as far as chemical properties were concerned.

Lise Meitner, who was Jewish, found it difficult to work in Germany,
however, for it was then under the rule of the strongly anti-Semitic
Nazi regime. In March 1938 Germany occupied Austria, which became part
of the German realm. Meitner was no longer protected by her Austrian
citizenship and had to flee the country and go to Stockholm, Sweden.
Hahn remained in Germany and continued working on the problem with the
German physical chemist Fritz Strassman (1902-    ).

Although the supposed radium, which possessed the radioactivity, was
very like barium in chemical properties, the two were not entirely
identical. There were ways of separating them, and Hahn and Strassman
busied themselves in trying to accomplish this in order to isolate the
radioactive isotopes, concentrate them, and study them in detail. Over
and over again, however, they failed to separate the barium and the
supposed radium.

Slowly, it began to seem to Hahn that the failure to separate the barium
and the radioactivity meant that the isotopes to which the radioactivity
belonged had to be so much like barium as to be nothing else _but_
barium. He hesitated to say so, however, because it seemed unbelievable.

If the radioactive isotopes included radium, that was conceivable.
Radium had an atomic number of 88, only four less than uranium’s 92. You
could imagine that a neutron being absorbed by a uranium nucleus might
make the latter so unstable as to cause it to emit 2 alpha particles and
become radium. Barium, however, had an atomic number of 56, only a
little over half that of uranium. How could a uranium nucleus be made to
turn into a barium nucleus unless it more or less broke in half? Nothing
like that had ever been observed before and Hahn hesitated to suggest
it.

While he was nerving himself to do so, however, Lise Meitner, in
Stockholm, receiving reports of what was being done in Hahn’s laboratory
and thinking about it, decided that unheard-of or not, there was only
one explanation. The uranium nucleus _was_ breaking in half.

Actually, when one stopped to think of it (after getting over the
initial shock) it wasn’t so unbelievable at that. The nuclear force is
so short-range, it barely reaches from end to end of a large nucleus
like that of uranium. Left to itself, it holds together most of the
time, but with the added energy of an entering neutron, we might imagine
shock waves going through it and turning the nucleus into something like
a quivering drop of liquid. Sometimes the uranium nucleus recovers,
keeps the neutron, and then goes on to beta-particle emission. And
sometimes the nucleus stretches to the point where the nuclear force
doesn’t quite hold it together. It becomes a dumbbell shape and then the
electromagnetic repulsion of the two halves (both positively charged)
breaks it apart altogether.

It doesn’t break into equal halves. Nor does it always break at exactly
the same place, so that there were a number of different fragments
possible (which was why there was so much confusion). Still, one of the
more common ways in which it might break would be into barium and
krypton. (Their respective atomic numbers, 56 and 36, would add up to
92.)

Meitner and her nephew, Otto Robert Frisch (1904-    ), who was in
Copenhagen, Denmark, prepared a paper suggesting that this was what was
happening. It was published in January 1939. Frisch passed it on to the
Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) with whom he was working. The
American biologist William Archibald Arnold (1904-    ), who was also
working in Copenhagen at the time, suggested that the splitting of the
uranium nucleus into halves be called “fission”, the term used for the
division-in-two of living cells. The name stuck.

In January 1939, just about the time Meitner and Frisch’s paper was
published, Bohr had arrived in the United States to attend a conference
of physicists. He carried the news of fission with him. The other
physicists attending the conference heard the news and in a high state
of excitement at once set about studying the problem. Within a matter of
weeks, the fact of uranium fission was confirmed over and over.

One striking fact about uranium fission was the large amount of energy
it released. In general, when a very massive nucleus is converted to a
less massive one, energy is released because of the change in the mass
defect, as Aston had shown in the 1920s. When the uranium nucleus breaks
down through the ordinary radioactive processes to become a less massive
lead nucleus, energy is given off accordingly. When, however, it breaks
in two to become the much less massive nuclei of barium and krypton (or
others in that neighborhood) much more energy is given off.

It quickly turned out that uranium fission gave off something like ten
times as much nuclear energy per nucleus than did any other nuclear
reaction known at the time.

Even so, the quantity of energy released by uranium fission was only a
tiny fraction of the energy that went into the preparation of the
neutrons used to bring about the fission, if each neutron that struck a
uranium atom brought about a single fission of that 1 atom.

Under those conditions, Rutherford’s suspicion that mankind would never
be able to tap nuclear energy probably still remained true. (He had been
dead for 2 years at the time of the discovery of fission.)

However, those were not the conditions.
",nuclear_energy_3,asimov,1972,0,1147
"
The Nuclear Chain Reaction

Earlier in this history, we discussed chain reactions involving chemical
energy. A small bit of energy can ignite a chemical reaction that would
produce more than enough energy to ignite a neighboring section of the
system, which would in turn produce still more—and so on, and so on. In
this way the flame of a single match could start a fire in a leaf that
would burn down an entire forest, and the energy given off by the
burning forest would be enormously higher than the initial energy of the
match flame.

Might there not be such a thing as a “nuclear chain reaction”? Could one
initiate a nuclear reaction that would produce something that would
initiate more of the same that would produce something that would
initiate still more of the same and so on?

In that case, a nuclear reaction, once started, would continue of its
own accord, and in return for the trifling investment that would serve
to start it—a single neutron, perhaps—a vast amount of breakdowns would
result with the delivery of a vast amount of energy. Even if it were
necessary to expend quite a bit of energy to produce the 1 neutron that
would start the chain reaction, one would end with an enormous profit.

What’s more, since the nuclear reaction would spread from nucleus to
nucleus with millionths-of-a-second intervals, there would be, in a very
brief time, so many nuclei breaking down that there would be a vast
explosion. The explosion was sure to be millions of times as powerful as
ordinary chemical explosions involving the same quantity of exploding
material, since the latter used only the electromagnetic interaction,
while the former used the much stronger nuclear interaction.

The first to think seriously of such a nuclear chain reaction was the
Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard (1898-1964). He was working in Germany
in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power and, since he was Jewish, he
felt it would be wise to leave Germany. He went to Great Britain and
there, in 1934, he considered certain new types of nuclear reactions
that had been discovered.

In these, it sometimes happened that a fast neutron might strike a
nucleus with sufficient energy to cause it to emit 2 neutrons. In that
way the nucleus, absorbing 1 neutron and emitting 2, would become a
lighter isotope of the same element.

But what would happen if each of the 2 neutrons that emerged from the
original target nucleus struck new nuclei and forced the emission of a
pair of neutrons from each. There would now be a total of 4 neutrons
flying about and if each struck new nuclei there would next be 8
neutrons and so on. From the initial investment of a single neutron
there might soon be countless billions initiating nuclear reactions.

Szilard, fearing the inevitability of war and fearing further that the
brutal leaders of Germany might seek and use such a nuclear chain
reaction as a weapon in warfare, secretly applied for a patent on a
device intending to make use of such a nuclear chain reaction. He hoped
to turn it over to the British Government, which might then use its
possession as a way of restraining the Nazis and keeping the peace.

However, it wouldn’t have worked. It took the impact of a very energetic
neutron to bring about the emission of 2 neutrons. The neutrons that
then emerged from the nucleus simply didn’t have enough energy to keep
things going. (It was like trying to make wet wood catch fire.)

But what about uranium fission? Uranium fission was initiated by slow
neutrons. What if uranium fission also produced neutrons as well as
being initiated by a neutron? Would not the neutrons produced serve to
initiate new fissions that would produce new neutrons and so on
endlessly?

It seemed very likely that fission produced neutrons and indeed, Fermi,
at the conference where fission was first discussed, suggested it at
once. Massive nuclei possessed more neutrons per proton than less
massive ones did. If a massive nucleus was broken up into 2 considerably
less massive ones, there would be a surplus of neutrons. Suppose, for
instance, uranium-238 broke down into barium-138 and krypton-86.
Barium-138 contains 82 neutrons and krypton-86 50 neutrons for a total
of 132. The uranium-238 nucleus, however, contains 146 neutrons.

The uranium fission process was studied at once to see if neutrons were
actually given off and a number of different physicists, including
Szilard, found that they were.

Now Szilard was faced with a nuclear chain reaction he was certain would
work. Only slow neutrons were involved and the individual nuclear
breakdowns were far more energetic than anything else that had yet been
discovered. If a chain reaction could be started in a sizable piece of
uranium, unimaginable quantities of energy would be produced. Just 1
gram of uranium, undergoing complete fission, would deliver the energy
derived from the total burning of 3 tons of coal and would deliver that
energy in a tiny fraction of a second.

Szilard, who had come to the United States in 1937, clearly visualized
the tremendous explosive force of something that would have to be called
a “nuclear bomb”. Szilard dreaded the possibility that Hitler might
obtain the use of such a bomb through the agency of Germany’s nuclear
scientists.

Partly through Szilard’s efforts, physicists in the United States and in
other Western nations opposed to Hitler began a program of voluntary
secrecy in 1940, to avoid passing along any hints to Germany. What’s
more, Szilard enlisted the services of two other Hungarian refugees, the
physicists Eugene Paul Wigner (1902-    ) and Edward Teller (1908-    )
and all approached Einstein, who had also fled Germany and come to
America.

[Illustration: _Leo Szilard_]

[Illustration: _Eugene P. Wigner_]

Einstein was the most prestigious scientist then living and it was
thought a letter from him to the President of the United States would be
most persuasive. Einstein signed such a letter, which explained the
possibility of a nuclear bomb and urged that the United States not allow
a potential enemy to come into possession of it first.

Largely as a result of this letter, a huge research team was put
together in the United States, to which other Western nations also
contributed, with but one aim—to develop the nuclear bomb.
",nuclear_energy_3,asimov,1972,0,1059
"
The Nuclear Bomb

Although the theory of the nuclear bomb seemed clear and simple, a great
many practical difficulties stood in the way. In the first place, if
only uranium atoms underwent fission a supply of uranium had at least to
be obtained in pure form, for if the neutrons struck nuclei of elements
other than uranium, they would simply be absorbed and removed from the
system, ending the possibility of a chain reaction. This alone was a
heavy task, since there had been so little use for uranium in quantity
that there was almost no supply in existence and no experience in how to
purify it.

Secondly, the supply of uranium might have to be a large one, for
neutrons didn’t necessarily enter the first uranium atom they
approached. They moved about here and there, making glancing collisions,
and travelling quite a distance, perhaps, before striking head-on and
entering a nucleus. If in that time they had passed outside the lump of
uranium, they were useless.

Sir:

Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated
to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be
turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate
future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call
for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the
Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your
attention the following facts and recommendations:

In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through
the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in
America—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction
in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large
quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it
appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate
future.

This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it
is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of
a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried
by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port
together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs
might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.

[Illustration: _Albert Einstein_]

  The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate
  quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former
  Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian
  Congo.

  In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some
  permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group
  of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way
  of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person
  who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial
  capacity. His task might comprise the following:

  a) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the
  further development, and put forward recommendations for Government
  action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a
  supply of uranium ore for the United States;

  b) to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being
  carried on within the limits of the budgets of University
  laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through
  his contacts with private persons who are willing to make
  contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the
  co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary
  equipment.

  I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium
  from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she
  should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the
  ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von
  Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where
  some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.

  Yours very truly,

As the quantity of uranium within which the fission chain reaction was
initiated grew larger, more and more of the neutrons produced found a
mark and the fission reaction would die out more and more slowly.
Finally, at some particular size—the “critical size”—the fission
reaction did not die at all, but maintained itself, with enough of the
neutrons produced finding their mark to keep the nuclear reaction
proceeding at a steady rate. At any greater size the nuclear reaction
would accelerate and there would be an explosion.

It wasn’t even necessary to send neutrons into the uranium to start the
process. In 1941 the Russian physicist Georgii Nikolaevich Flerov
(1913-    ) found that every once in a while a uranium atom would
undergo fission without the introduction of a neutron. Occasionally the
random quivering of a nucleus would bring about a shape that the nuclear
interaction could not bring back to normal and the nucleus would then
break apart. In a gram of ordinary uranium, there is a nucleus
undergoing such “spontaneous fission” every 2 minutes on the average.
Therefore, enough uranium need only be brought together to surpass
critical size and it will explode within seconds, for the first nucleus
that undergoes spontaneous fission will start the chain reaction.

First estimates made it seem that the quantity of uranium needed to
reach critical size was extraordinarily great. Fully 99.3% of the metal
is uranium-238, however, and, as soon as fission was discovered, Bohr
pointed out that there were theoretical reasons for supposing that it
was the uranium-235 isotope (making up only 0.7% of the whole) that was
the one undergoing fission. Investigation proved him right. Indeed, the
uranium-238 nucleus tended to absorb slow neutrons without fission, and
to go on to beta-particle production that formed isotopes of neptunium
and plutonium. In this way uranium-238 actually interfered with the
chain reaction.

In any quantity of uranium, the more uranium-235 present and the less
uranium-238, the more easily the chain reaction would proceed and the
lower the critical size needed. Vast efforts were therefore made to
separate the 2 isotopes and prepare uranium with a higher than normal
concentration of uranium-235 (“enriched uranium”).

Of course, there was no great desire for a fearful explosion to get out
of hand while the chain reaction was being studied. Before any bomb
could be constructed, the mechanism of the chain reaction would have to
be studied. Could a chain reaction capable of producing energy (for
useful purposes as well as for bombs) be established? To test this, a
quantity of uranium was gathered in the hope that a _controlled_ chain
reaction of uranium fission could be established. For that purpose,
control rods of a substance that would easily absorb neutrons and slow
the chain reaction were used. The metal, cadmium, served admirably for
this purpose.

Then, too, the neutrons released by fission were pretty energetic. They
tended to travel too far too soon and get outside the lump of uranium
too easily. To produce a chain reaction that could be studied with some
safety, the presence of a moderator was needed. This was a supply of
small nuclei that did not absorb neutrons readily, but absorbed some of
the energy of collision and slowed down any neutron that struck it.
Nuclei such as hydrogen-2, beryllium-9, or carbon-12 were useful
moderators. When the neutrons produced by fission were slowed, they
travelled a smaller distance before being absorbed in their turn and the
critical size would again be reduced.

Toward the end of 1942 the initial stage of the project reached a
climax. Blocks of graphite containing uranium metal and uranium oxide
were piled up in huge quantities (enriched uranium was not yet
available) in order to approach critical size. This took place under the
stands of a football stadium at the University of Chicago, with Enrico
Fermi (who had come to the United States in 1938) in charge.[1]

The large structure was called an “atomic pile” at first because of the
blocks of graphite being piled up. The proper name for such a device,
and the one that was eventually adopted, was, however, “nuclear
reactor”.

On December 2, 1942, calculations showed that the nuclear reactor was
large enough to have reached critical size. The only thing preventing
the chain reaction from sustaining itself was the cadmium rods that were
inserted here and there in the pile and that were soaking up neutrons.

[Illustration: _Cutaway model of the West Stands of Stagg Field showing
the first pile in the squash court beneath it._]

[Illustration: _The exterior of the building._]

[Illustration: _Graphite layers form the base of the pile, left. On the
right is the seventh layer of graphite and edges of the sixth layer
containing 3¼-inch pseudospheres of black uranium oxide. Beginning with
layer 6, alternate courses of graphite containing uranium metal and/or
uranium oxide fuel were separated by layers of solid graphite blocks._]

[Illustration: _Tenth layer of graphite blocks containing pseudospheres
of black and brown uranium oxide. The brown briquets, slightly richer in
uranium, were concentrated in the central area. On the right is the
nineteenth layer of graphite covering layer 18 containing slugs of
uranium oxide._]

One by one the cadmium rods were pulled out. The number of uranium atoms
undergoing fission each second rose and, finally, at 3:45 p.m., the
uranium fission became self-sustaining. It kept going on its own (with
the cadmium rods ready to be pushed in if it looked as though it were
getting out of hand—something calculations showed was not likely).

News of this success was announced to Washington by a cautious telephone
call from Arthur Holly Compton (1892-1962) to James Bryant Conant
(1893-    ). “The Italian navigator has landed in the new world”, said
Compton. Conant asked, “How were the natives?”, and the answer was,
“Very friendly”.

This was the day and moment when the world entered the “nuclear age”.
For the first time, mankind had constructed a device in which the
nuclear energy being given off was greater than the energy poured in.
Mankind had tapped the reservoirs of nuclear energy and could put it to
use. Had Rutherford lived but 6 more years, he would have seen how wrong
he was to think it could never be done.

The people of earth remained unaware of what had taken place in Chicago
and physicists continued to work toward the development of the nuclear
bomb.

Enriched uranium was successfully prepared. Critical sizes were brought
low enough to make a nuclear bomb small enough to be carried by plane to
some target. Suppose one had 2 slabs of enriched uranium, each below
critical size, but which were above critical size if combined. And
suppose an explosive device were added that, at some desired moment,
could be set off in such a way that it would drive 1 slab of enriched
uranium against the other. There would be an instant explosion of
devastating power. Or suppose the enriched uranium were arranged in
loosely packed pieces to begin with so that the flying neutrons were in
open air too often to maintain the chain reaction. A properly arranged
explosion might compress the uranium into a dense ball. Neutron
absorption would become more efficient and again, an explosion would
follow.

[Illustration: _Nuclear Fission of Uranium: A neutron hits the nucleus
of an atom of uranium. The neutron splits the nucleus into two parts and
creates huge amounts of energy in the form of heat. At the same time
other neutrons are released from the splitting nucleus and these
continue the fission process in a chain reaction._]

On July 16, 1945, a device that would result in a nuclear explosion was
set up near Alamogordo, New Mexico, with nervous physicists watching
from a safe distance. It worked perfectly; the explosion was tremendous.
",nuclear_energy_3,asimov,1972,0,1299
"
By that time Nazi Germany had been defeated, but Japan was still
fighting. Two more devices were prepared. After a warning, one was
exploded over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and the
other over Nagasaki 2 days later. The Japanese government surrendered
and World War II came to an end.

It was with the blast over Hiroshima that the world came to know it was
in the nuclear age and that the ferocious weapon of the nuclear bomb
existed. (The popular name for it at the time was “atomic bomb” or
“A-bomb”.)

During the war, German scientists may have been trying to develop a
nuclear bomb, but, if so, they had not yet succeeded at the time Germany
met its final defeat. Soviet physicists, under Igor Vasilievich
Kurchatov (1903-1960), were also working on the problem. The dislocation
of the war, which inflicted much more damage on the Soviet Union than on
the United States, kept the Soviet effort from succeeding while it was
on. However, since the Soviets were among the victors, they were able to
continue after the war.

In 1949 the Soviets exploded their first nuclear bomb. In 1952 the
British did the same; in 1960, the French; and in 1964, the Chinese.

Although many nuclear bombs have been exploded for test purposes, the
two over Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been the only ones used in time of
war.

Nor need nuclear bombs be considered as having destructive potential
only. There is the possibility that, with proper precautions, they might
be used to make excavations, blast out harbors or canals, break up
underground rock formations to recover oil or other resources, and in
other ways do the work of chemical explosives with far greater speed and
economy. It has even been suggested that a series of nuclear bomb
explosions might be used to hurl space vehicles forward in voyages away
from earth.

Nuclear Reactors

The development of the nuclear chain reaction was not in the direction
of bombs only. Nuclear reactors designed for the controlled production
of useful energy multiplied in number and in efficiency since Fermi’s
first “pile”. Many nations now possess them, and they are used for a
variety of purposes.[2]

[Illustration: _The USS_ Nautilus, _the world’s first nuclear powered
submarine, in New York harbor_.]

In 1954 the first nuclear submarine the USS _Nautilus_ was launched by
the United States. Its power was obtained entirely from a nuclear
reactor, and it was not necessary for it to rise to the surface at short
intervals in order to recharge its batteries. Nuclear submarines have
crossed the Arctic Ocean under the ice cover, and have circumnavigated
the globe without surfacing.

In 1959 both the Soviet Union and the United States launched
nuclear-powered surface vessels. The Soviet ship was the icebreaker,
_Lenin_, and the American ship was a merchant vessel, the NS _Savannah_.

In the 1950s nuclear reactors were also used as the source of power for
the production of electricity for civilian use. The Soviet Union built a
small station of this sort in 1954, which had a capacity of 5,000
kilowatts. The British built one of 92,000 kilowatt capacity, which they
called Calder Hall. The first American nuclear reactor for civilian use
began operation at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, in 1958. It was the first
really full-scale civilian nuclear power plant in the world.

The world appeared to have far greater sources of energy than had been
expected. The “fossil fuels”—coal, oil and natural gas—were being used
at such a rate that many speculated that the gas and oil would be gone
in decades and the coal in centuries. Was it possible that uranium might
now serve as a new source that would last indefinitely?

It was rather disappointing that it was uranium-235 which underwent
fission, because that isotope made up only 0.7% of the uranium that
existed. If uranium-235 were all we had and all we ever could have, the
energy supply of the world would still be rather too limited.

There were other possible “nuclear fuels”, however. There was
plutonium-239, which would also fission under neutron bombardment. It
had an ordinary half-life (for a radioactive change in which it gave off
alpha particles) of 24,300 years, which is long enough to make it easy
to handle.

But how can plutonium-239 be formed in sufficient quantities to be
useful? After all, it doesn’t occur in nature. Surprisingly, that turned
out to be easy. Uranium-238 atoms will absorb many of the neutrons that
are constantly leaking out of the reactor and will become first
neptunium-239 and then plutonium-239. The plutonium, being a different
element from the uranium, can be separated from uranium and obtained in
useful quantities.

Such a device is called a “breeder reactor” because it breeds fuel.
Indeed, it can be so designed to produce more plutonium-239 than the
uranium-235 it uses up, so that you actually end up with more nuclear
fuel than you started with. In this way, all the uranium on earth (and
not just uranium-235) can be considered potential nuclear fuel.

[Illustration: _The Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the first
full-scale, nuclear-electric station built exclusively for civilian
needs, provides electricity for the homes and factories of the greater
Pittsburgh area. The pressurized-water reactor, which now has a
90,000-net-electrical-kilowatt capacity, began commercial operation in
1957. The reactor is in the large building in the center._]

[Illustration: _The lights of downtown Pittsburgh._]

The first breeder reactor was completed at Arco, Idaho, in August 1951,
and on December 20 produced the very first electricity on earth to come
from nuclear power. Nevertheless, breeder reactors for commercial use
are still a matter for the future.[3]

Another isotope capable of fissioning under neutron bombardment is
uranium-233. It does not occur in nature, but was formed in the
laboratory by Seaborg and others in 1942. It has a half-life of 162,000
years. It can be formed from naturally occurring thorium-232.
Thorium-232 will absorb a neutron to become thorium-233. Then 2 beta
particles are given off so that the thorium-233 becomes first
protactinium-233 and then uranium-233.

If a thorium shell surrounds a nuclear reactor, fissionable uranium-233
is formed within it and is easily separated from the thorium. In this
way, thorium is also added to the list of earth’s potential nuclear
fuels.[4]

"
            She'd paid good money to see the inevitable ...
                and then had to work to make it happen!


There were two important things--one, that she was very old; two, that
Mr. Thirkell was taking her to God. For hadn't he patted her hand and
said: ""Mrs. Bellowes, we'll take off into space in my rocket, and go
to find Him together.""

And that was how it was going to be. Oh, this wasn't like any other
group Mrs. Bellowes had ever joined. In her fervor to light a path for
her delicate, tottering feet, she had struck matches down dark alleys,
and found her way to Hindu mystics who floated their flickering, starry
eyelashes over crystal balls. She had walked on the meadow paths with
ascetic Indian philosophers imported by daughters-in-spirit of Madame
Blavatsky. She had made pilgrimages to California's stucco jungles
to hunt the astrological seer in his natural habitat. She had even
consented to signing away the rights to one of her homes in order to be
taken into the shouting order of a temple of amazing evangelists who
had promised her golden smoke, crystal fire, and the great soft hand of
God coming to bear her home.

None of these people had ever shaken Mrs. Bellowes' faith, even when
she saw them sirened away in a black wagon in the night, or discovered
their pictures, bleak and unromantic, in the morning tabloids. The
world had roughed them up and locked them away because they knew too
much, that was all.

And then, two weeks ago, she had seen Mr. Thirkell's advertisement in
New York City:

    COME TO MARS!

    Stay at the Thirkell Restorium for one week. And then, on into
    space on the greatest adventure life can offer!

    Send for Free Pamphlet: ""Nearer My God To Thee.""

    Excursion rates. Round trip slightly lower.

""Round trip,"" Mrs. Bellowes had thought. ""But who would come back after
seeing _Him_?""

And so she had bought a ticket and flown off to Mars and spent seven
mild days at Mr. Thirkell's Restorium, the building with the sign on it
which flashed: THIRKELL'S ROCKET TO HEAVEN! She had spent the
week bathing in limpid waters and erasing the care from her tiny bones,
and now she was fidgeting, ready to be loaded into Mr. Thirkell's own
special private rocket, like a bullet, to be fired on out into space
beyond Jupiter and Saturn and Pluto. And thus--who could deny it?--you
would be getting nearer and nearer to the Lord. How wonderful! Couldn't
you just _feel_ Him drawing near? Couldn't you just sense His breath,
His scrutiny, His Presence?

""Here I am,"" said Mrs. Bellowes, ""an ancient rickety elevator, ready to
go up the shaft. God need only press the button.""

Now, on the seventh day, as she minced up the steps of the Restorium, a
number of small doubts assailed her.

""For one thing,"" she said aloud to no one, ""it isn't quite the land of
milk and honey here on Mars that they said it would be. My room is like
a cell, the swimming pool is really quite inadequate, and, besides, how
many widows who look like mushrooms or skeletons want to swim? And,
finally, the whole Restorium smells of boiled cabbage and tennis shoes!""

She opened the front door and let it slam, somewhat irritably.

She was amazed at the other women in the auditorium. It was like
wandering in a carnival mirror-maze, coming again and again upon
yourself--the same floury face, the same chicken hands, and jingling
bracelets. One after another of the images of herself floated before
her. She put out her hand, but it wasn't a mirror; it was another lady
shaking her fingers and saying:

""We're waiting for Mr. Thirkell. _Sh!_""

""Ah,"" whispered everyone.

The velvet curtains parted.

Mr. Thirkell appeared, fantastically serene, his Egyptian eyes upon
everyone. But there was something, nevertheless, in his appearance
which made one expect him to call ""Hi!"" while fuzzy dogs jumped over
his legs, through his hooped arms, and over his back. Then, dogs and
all, he should dance with a dazzling piano-keyboard smile off into the
wings.

Mrs. Bellowes, with a secret part of her mind which she constantly had
to grip tightly, expected to hear a cheap Chinese gong sound when Mr.
Thirkell entered. His large liquid dark eyes were so improbable that
one of the old ladies had facetiously claimed she saw a mosquito cloud
hovering over them as they did around summer rain-barrels. And Mrs.
Bellowes sometimes caught the scent of the theatrical mothball and the
smell of calliope steam on his sharply pressed suit.
",a_little_journey,bradbury,1951,1,771
"
But with the same savage rationalization that had greeted all other
disappointments in her rickety life, she bit at the suspicion and
whispered, ""This time it's _real_. This time it'll work. Haven't we got
a _rocket_?""

Mr. Thirkell bowed. He smiled a sudden Comedy Mask smile. The old
ladies looked in at his epiglottis and sensed chaos there.

Before he even began to speak, Mrs. Bellowes saw him picking up each of
his words, oiling it, making sure it ran smooth on its rails. Her heart
squeezed in like a tiny fist, and she gritted her porcelain teeth.

""Friends,"" said Mr. Thirkell, and you could hear the frost snap in the
hearts of the entire assemblage.

""No!"" said Mrs. Bellowes ahead of time. She could hear the bad news
rushing at her, and herself tied to the track while the immense black
wheels threatened and the whistle screamed, helpless.

""There will be a slight delay,"" said Mr. Thirkell.

In the next instant, Mr. Thirkell might have cried, or been tempted to
cry, ""Ladies, be seated!"" in minstrel-fashion, for the ladies had come
up at him from their chairs, protesting and trembling.

""Not a very long delay."" Mr. Thirkell put up his hands to pat the air.

""How long?""

""Only a week.""

""A week!""

""Yes. You can stay here at the Restorium for seven more days, can't
you? A little delay won't matter, will it, in the end? You've waited a
lifetime. Only a few more days.""

_At twenty dollars a day_, thought Mrs. Bellowes, coldly.

""What's the trouble?"" a woman cried.

""A legal difficulty,"" said Mr. Thirkell.

""We've a rocket, haven't we?""

""Well, ye-ess.""

""But I've been here a whole month, waiting,"" said one old lady.
""Delays, delays!""

""That's right,"" said everyone.

""Ladies, ladies,"" murmured Mr. Thirkell, smiling serenely.

""We want to see the rocket!"" It was Mrs. Bellowes forging ahead,
alone, brandishing her fist like a toy hammer.

Mr. Thirkell looked into the old ladies' eyes, a missionary among
albino cannibals.

""Well, now,"" he said.

""Yes, _now_!"" cried Mrs. Bellowes.

""I'm afraid--"" he began.

""So am I!"" she said. ""That's why we want to see the ship!""

""No, no, now, Mrs.--"" He snapped his fingers for her name.

""Bellowes!"" she cried. She was a small container, but now all the
seething pressures that had been built up over long years came
steaming through the delicate vents of her body. Her cheeks became
incandescent. With a wail that was like a melancholy factory whistle,
Mrs. Bellowes ran forward and hung to him, almost by her teeth, like a
summer-maddened Spitz. She would not and never could let go, until he
died, and the other women followed, jumping and yapping like a pound
let loose on its trainer, the same one who had petted them and to whom
they had squirmed and whined joyfully an hour before, now milling about
him, creasing his sleeves and frightening the Egyptian serenity from
his gaze.

""This way!"" cried Mrs. Bellowes, feeling like Madame Lafarge. ""Through
the back! We've waited long enough to see the ship. Every day he's put
us off, every day we've waited, now let's see.""

""No, no, ladies!"" cried Mr. Thirkell, leaping about.

They burst through the back of the stage and out a door, like a flood,
bearing the poor man with them into a shed, and then out, quite
suddenly, into an abandoned gymnasium.

""There it is!"" said someone. ""The rocket.""

And then a silence fell that was terrible to entertain.

There was the rocket.

Mrs. Bellowes looked at it and her hands sagged away from Mr.
Thirkell's collar.

The rocket was something like a battered copper pot. There were a
thousand bulges and rents and rusty pipes and dirty vents on and in it.
The ports were clouded over with dust, resembling the eyes of a blind
hog.

Everyone wailed a little sighing wail.

""Is that the rocket ship _Glory Be to the Highest_?"" cried Mrs.
Bellowes, appalled.

Mr. Thirkell nodded and looked at his feet.

""For which we paid out our one thousand dollars apiece and came all the
way to Mars to get on board with you and go off to find Him?"" asked
Mrs. Bellowes.

""Why, that isn't worth a sack of dried peas,"" said Mrs. Bellowes.

""It's nothing but junk!""

_Junk_, whispered everyone, getting hysterical.

""Don't let him get away!""

Mr. Thirkell tried to break and run, but a thousand possum traps closed
on him from every side. He withered.

Everybody walked around in circles like blind mice. There was a
confusion and a weeping that lasted for five minutes as they went over
and touched the Rocket, the Dented Kettle, the Rusty Container for
God's Children.

""Well,"" said Mrs. Bellowes. She stepped up into the askew doorway of
the rocket and faced everyone. ""It looks as if a terrible thing has
been done to us,"" she said. ""I haven't any money to go back home to
Earth and I've too much pride to go to the Government and tell them
a common man like this has fooled us out of our life's savings. I
don't know how you feel about it, all of you, but the reason all of us
came is because I'm eighty-five, and you're eighty-nine, and you're
seventy-eight, and all of us are nudging on toward a hundred, and
there's nothing on Earth for us, and it doesn't appear there's anything
on Mars either. We all expected not to breathe much more air or crochet
many more doilies or we'd never have come here. So what I have to
propose is a simple thing--to take a chance.""
",a_little_journey,bradbury,1951,1,937
"
She reached out and touched the rusted hulk of the rocket.

""This is _our_ rocket. We paid for our trip. And we're going to _take_
our trip!""

Everyone rustled and stood on tiptoes and opened an astonished mouth.

Mr. Thirkell began to cry. He did it quite easily and very effectively.

""We're going to get in this ship,"" said Mrs. Bellowes, ignoring him.
""And we're going to take off to where we were going.""

Mr. Thirkell stopped crying long enough to say, ""But it was all a fake.
I don't know anything about space. He's not out there, anyway. I lied.
I don't know where He is, and I couldn't find Him if I wanted to. And
you were fools to ever take my word on it.""

""Yes,"" said Mrs. Bellowes, ""we were fools. I'll go along on that. But
you can't blame us, for we're old, and it was a lovely, good and fine
idea, one of the loveliest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really
fool ourselves that we could get nearer to Him physically. It was the
gentle, mad dream of old people, the kind of thing you hold onto for a
few minutes a day, even though you know it's not true. So, all of you
who want to go, you follow me in the ship.""

""But you can't go!"" said Mr. Thirkell. ""You haven't got a navigator.
And that ship's a ruin!""

""You,"" said Mrs. Bellowes, ""will be the navigator.""

She stepped into the ship, and after a moment, the other old ladies
pressed forward. Mr. Thirkell, windmilling his arms frantically,
was nevertheless pressed through the port, and in a minute the door
slammed shut. Mr. Thirkell was strapped into the navigator's seat, with
everyone talking at once and holding him down. The special helmets
were issued to be fitted over every gray or white head to supply extra
oxygen in case of a leakage in the ship's hull, and at long last the
hour had come and Mrs. Bellowes stood behind Mr. Thirkell and said,
""We're ready, sir.""

He said nothing. He pleaded with them silently, using his great, dark,
wet eyes, but Mrs. Bellowes shook her head and pointed to the control.

""Takeoff,"" agreed Mr. Thirkell morosely, and pulled a switch.

Everybody fell. The rocket went up from the planet Mars in a great
fiery glide, with the noise of an entire kitchen thrown down an
elevator shaft, with a sound of pots and pans and kettles and fires
boiling and stews bubbling, with a smell of burned incense and
rubber and sulphur, with a color of yellow fire, and a ribbon of red
stretching below them, and all the old women singing and holding
to each other, and Mrs. Bellowes crawling upright in the sighing,
straining, trembling ship.

""Head for space, Mr. Thirkell.""

""It can't last,"" said Mr. Thirkell, sadly. ""This ship can't last. It
will--""

It did.

The rocket exploded.

Mrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like a
doll. She heard the great screamings and saw the flashes of bodies
sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery light.

""Help, help!"" cried Mr. Thirkell, far away, on a small radio beam.

The ship disintegrated into a million parts, and the old ladies,
all one hundred of them, were flung straight on ahead with the same
velocity as the ship.

As for Mr. Thirkell, for some reason of trajectory, perhaps, he had
been blown out the other side of the ship. Mrs. Bellowes saw him
falling separate and away from them, screaming, screaming.

_There goes Mr. Thirkell_, thought Mrs. Bellowes.

And she knew where he was going. He was going to be burned and roasted
and broiled good, but very good.

Mr. Thirkell was falling down into the Sun.

_And here we are_, thought Mrs. Bellowes. _Here we are, going on out,
and out, and out._

There was hardly a sense of motion at all, but she knew that she was
traveling at fifty thousand miles an hour and would continue to travel
at that speed for an eternity, until....

She saw the other women swinging all about her in their own
trajectories, a few minutes of oxygen left to each of them in their
helmets, and each was looking up to where they were going.

_Of course_, thought Mrs. Bellowes. _Out into space. Out and out, and
the darkness like a great church, and the stars like candles, and in
spite of everything, Mr. Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we
are going toward the Lord._

And there, yes, _there_, as she fell on and on, coming toward her,
she could almost discern the outline now, coming toward her was His
mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a
frightened sparrow....

""I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes,"" she said quietly, in her best company
voice. ""I'm from the planet Earth.""

THE VOICE OF SCARILIOP

H. V. B.


Four pillars, arising out of the stone like strange growing things of
demoniac shape--these Redforth saw and comprehended, knowing full well
that Tarath had always abounded in monstrosities. ""But what,"" he asked
himself, ""will knowing of such as this, be of use to me, as I search for
Ghiltharmie?"" For he had at last come to realise, to admit even to
himself, that he was a lost thing. The Yulphog had taken his soul. They
had exiled him to this lost land of dread. But they'd hinted of escape,
if he could find it. ""Si Yamlon,"" he had told him, pointing to a
writhing belt of suns, lifting and lowering at the horizon like the
yellow crest of a flaming wave. And he had nodded his head. They had
vanished, disintegrating, it seemed. He didn't then know that they were
related to Topper's friends and the jeep in one thing: that their
Typonisif and Tregoifer was applicable to the atmosphere.

The four pillars were bending from their own weight. Strange
colors--like an idiot's conception of a spectrum, spectrally rippled
like irid waves across the columns. Like music in color. Assailed by
their complex harmonies, Redforth could only stand speechless, hands
thrust defensively forward. IT WAS THEN THAT HE SAW EIRY.

The pillars split. From each of then drifted a whiff of steam. They
united into a wavering cloud which shimmered an instant in mid-air, then
settled to the ground. And as it touched the metallic grass blades which
stretched on and on like the upraised swords of a midget army, the
vapor-cloud condensed into a woman's body. EIRY. Queen of Scariliop!

He recognized her at once, tho he had only read of her. She was not
human. Her body was like a snake's, and she had bat wings. From a
cluster of writhing worm-tentacles leered her face, like a mask in the
heart of a seething flower. It was oval, and the scarlet mouth was like
a velvet cushion--disproportionate--waiting for some priceless burden.
Her nose was negligible, but her lone eye was vast and blue; like a
doorway opening upon a sky too blue to belong to our world. Like blue
incarnate: and blue is the color of MYSTERY.

She opened her mouth, and her tongue unrolled, uncoiled toward Redforth.
Three feet long, the tongue was filamental, like a strand of red cobweb,
tipped by a touch of fluff like a dandelion's seed. This member wandered
lightly over Redforth's cheek, and for the first time EIRY spoke: ""It
comes to me that here is the man for whom we have been seeking,
Yasgorphitove."" Her voice was soft as clouds. Redforth in vain peered to
behold her companion. ""Now shall we enlighten him as to the ways of
escape? In return for a favor, of course.""

The air about her, for a fleeting instant, had turned blue. Then she
nodded. She leaned forward, to whisper, but suddenly there was a
crackling. ""The rock!"" she cried. ""The rock! I must return before it is
too late and I too am trapped!"" She writhed, became coiling wreathes of
smoke, and the smoke flowed back to the rocks, hovered over it. The four
pillars quivered and joined into one and then, in a twinkling, had
crumbled to powder.

But there was an uncanny blueness in the air about Redforth. And that
night he had a dreadful dream.

For he had become--Yrthicaol! And EIRY had been merely--THE BAIT!


AW G'WAN!

_HENRY HASSE_


THERE! If ""Foo E. Onya"", in the last issue, could use a pseudonym so can
I. I read his article, I'M THROUGH, with varying degrees of interest. If
an answer were really necessary, it could be found more appropriately in
the two words of my title above, than in any words that might follow.
And that brings up my first point in my rebuttal--

Why is it that people, including the lowly science-fiction fan, (to
paraphrase Mr. Onya) always feel it necessary to hide behind a pseudonym
when they have something to say which they think will displease someone?
I've seen this happen so many times! And, coincidently, why SHOULD Mr.
Onya take such pains to be unpleasent in print? Why should he feel it
necessary to make one final, grand broadcast to the effect that he will
no longer read paltry science-fiction? Does he think that any real lover
of sci-fic gives a damn whether there is one less reader, especially a
reader who crawls behind such a silly pseudonym as ""Onya""? I've seen
other broadcasts such as Mr. Onya's, and they always puzzled me. It
surely can be nothing else but the egotistical urge.

But I'm convinced that Onya isn't half so bitter really against
sci-fiction as he tries to pretend. He's not really through. Because
anyone really bitter against and through with sci-fic would simply stop
reading it, not start deriding it! And I doubt if any person, once a
fan, has ever completely broken away from sci-fic, THEY ALWAYS COME
BACK.

And right here I'd like to say that a good deal of my doubt as to Onya's
sincerity is because I'm fairly certain of the fellow's real identity.
The general tone of his article, and several clues he divulged, convince
me I'm right. And if I AM right, I can assure you, Brad, and any other
readers who nay have been picqued at Onya's tone, that he shouldn't be
taken seriously, and the less attention paid to his rantings, the
better. I'm sure Onya would feel flattered if he thot someone took his
article so seriously as to answer it. Yet here I am answering it, and
damned if I know why, except that I think I took some of Mr. Onya's
phrasing personally, almost. I don't think he should have gone to the
extent of calling names and using words such as ""moronic"", ""arrogant"",
etc.

Aside from this his piece seemed to me a conglomeration of
contradictions, inconsistencies, praises here, derisions there, pats on
the back, exaggerations, sneers and scorn, and, oh yes, a book review.
Yes, I liked and appreciated and mostly agreed with Onya's comments on
BRAVE NEW WORLD. It's a book which I'm sure sure many of the _moronic_
sci-fic fans appreciated as well as Mr, Onya. But here's where Mr.
Onya's and my tastes differ slightly, for I _also_ liked PLANET OF THE
KNOB HEADS in the Dec. issue of SCIENCE FICTION, whereas Mr. Onya
probably wouldn't deign to read it because it's in one of the pulp mags.
that he so deplores; thereby Mr. Onya would be missing a really
entertaining and meaningful piece of writing, but that's all right,
since Mr. Onya's own words said: ""There is so much else of importance
that has been written--"".
",futuria,bradbury,1940,1,1132
"
You know, somehow I cannot bring myself to be as vitriolic against Mr.
Onya as he was against sfn at moments. He tried hard to work up a case
against sfn, poor fellow, and became (to me at least) amusing instead of
convincing. Do you know what I saw? I saw a person who is temporarily
_satiated_, as he said, with sfn,--but more than that, a person who is
merely trying to persuade _himself_, more than other people, that sfn is
as bad as he painted it! Naturally every fan has his likes and dislikes
of the various stories, authors and magazines. Some have more _dislikes_
than likes. I think even I do. But it must be admitted that every once
in a while, usually unexpectedly, there pops up a story which is a
delectable gem and a masterpiece, either of ingenuity or writing or
both. Then one is exultant, and one continues reading sfn, even some
trite and bad sfn, knowing that regularly he will encounter one of the
gems which he wouldn't have missed reading for the world! Meanwhile we
have with us Clark Ashton Smith, C. L. Moore, Stanton Coblentz
(delightful sometimes, not always), A. Merritt, and an occasional few
others, whose work I doubt if even Mr. Onya could glibly pronounce as
ordinary pulp. And we did have Lovecraft, Weinbaum, Howard, and others
of whom the same thing can be said.

Naturally, too, a lot of criticism can be directed against sfn and sfn
readers. A lot of criticism can be directed against _everything_, and
usually is, by certain people who take an unholy delight in it. I myself
have sometimes snorted in wrath at the gross egotism and, yes, stupidity
and childishness, of certain fans. I would have taken great delight in
kicking their blooming teeth down their bloody well bally throats. But
did I do this? Did I succumb to this desire? No, I did not. I never got
close enough. A more important reason is that I had the patience to
realize this type of fan is a minority (_not_ a majority, Mr. Onya, by
any means!). But what I did _not_ do was write bitter articles about it.

Here is only one of Mr. Onya's inconsistencies: he makes such
statements as ""fans are arrogant, blind, critically moronic"", etc.--and
""editors and writers as well cannot see anything beyond their own
perverted models."" In virtually the next breath he admires P. Schuyler
Miller's intellectuality. Yet P. Schuyler Miller continues to write
sfn, reads it, and is one of the active fans.

Furthermore, I disagree outright and violently with Onya's statement,
""When literature becomes possessed of _ideas as such_, it is no longer
literature."" And I'd like to challenge Onya to a further debate on this,
if he _dares_. Also his statement about Wells' early stories. It so
happens (what a coincidence!) that I also read Wells' EXPERIMENT IN
AUTOBIOGRAPHY--and yes, while Wells did admit his early sfn stories were
a preparation for his later and more serious writing, he did _not_
disclaim them as not being literature of their own type. The trouble
with Mr. Onya, I'm afraid, is that he has (deliberately?) lost sight of
the fact that there is literature _and_ literature. Instead, he wants
everything to conform precisely to his own rather peculiar conception of
literature. I'll make a statement right here that will undoubtedly shock
Mr. Onya: I'll go so far as to say that pulp fiction, even the pulpiest
of pulp fiction, is really and truly LITERATURE, insofar as it has its
own special niche, its own certain purpose for being. There, I've said
it! I'll admit, Mr. Onya, that it took a little courage to say it. But I
ask all who read this, isn't it true when you come to think of it?

I have not dealt with Onya's article nearly to the extent that I might,
but I don't think it's really necessary, mainly because, as I said, I
have a very strong idea who Foo E. Onya is. I wish I could hazard my
suspicion right here, but I'm so sure I'm right, and both the editor and
Onya seem so determined to keep it secret, that I cannot be otherwise
than silent. I will merely conclude by reiterating my doubt that you,
""Foo E. Onya"", are really disclaiming sfn. At least I hope you will
continue both reading and writing it. But I swear, if I ever hear of you
doing so, I shall feel sorely tempted to broadcast what a hypocrite you
were with that article!



THE FIGHT OF THE GOOD SHIP CLARISSA

by one who should know better


The space rocket Clarissa was nine days out from Venus. The members of
the crew were also out for nine days. They were hunters, fearless
expeditionists who bagged game in Venusian jungles. At the start of our
story they are busy bagging their pants, not to forget their eyes. A
sort of lull has fallen over the ship (Note: a lull is a time warp that
frequently attacks rockets and seduces its members into a siesta). It
was during this lull that Anthony Quelch sat sprawled at his typewriter
looking as baggy as a bag of unripe grapefruit. ANTHONY QUELCH, the
Cosmic Clamor Boy, with a face like turned linoleum on the third term,
busy writing a book: ""Fascism is Communism with a shave"" for which he
would receive 367 rubles, 10 pazinkas and incarceration in a cinema
showing Gone With The Wind.

The boys upstairs were throwing a party in the control room. They had
been throwing the same party so long the party looked like a worn out
first edition of a trapeze artist. There is doubt in our mind as to
whether they were trying to break the party up or just do the morning
mopping and break the lease simultaneously. Arms, legs and heads
littered the deck. The boys, it seems, threw a party at the drop of a
chin. Sort of a space cataclysm with rules and little regulation--kind
of an atomic convulsion in the front parlor. The neighbors never
complained. The neighbors were 450 million miles away. And the boys were
tighter than a catsup bottle at lunch-time. The last time the captain
had looked up the hatch and called to his kiddies in a gentle voice,
""HELL!"" the kiddies had thrown snowballs at him. The captain had
vanished. Clever way they make these space bombs nowadays. A few minutes
previous the boys had been tearing up old Amazings and throwing them at
one another, but now they contented themselves with tearing up just the
editors. Palmer was torn in half and he sat in a corner arguing with
himself about rejecting a story for an hour before someone put him
through an orange juice machine killing him. (Orange juice sorry, now?)

And then they landed on Venus. How in heck they got back there so quick
is a wonder of science, but there they were. ""Come on, girls!"" cried
Quelch, ""put on your shin guards, get out there and dig ditches for good
old W.P.A. and the Rover Boys Academy, earth branch 27!""

Out into the staggering rain they dashed. Five minutes later they came
back in, gasping, reeling. They had forgotten their corsets! The
Venusians closed in like a million land-lords. ""Charge, men!"" cried
Quelch, running the other way. And then--BATTLE! ""What a fight; folks,""
cried Quelch. ""Twenty thousand earth men against two Venusians! We're
outnumbered, but we'll fight!"" BLOOSH! ""Correction--ten thousand men
fighting!"" KERBLOM! ""One hundred men from earth left!"" BOOM! ""This is
the last man speaking, folks! What a fight. I ain't had so much fun
since--Help, someone just clipped my corset strings!"" BWOM! ""Someone
just clipped me!""

The field was silent. The ship lay gleaming in the pink light of dawn
that was just blooming over the mountains like a pale flower. The two
Venusians stood weeping over the bodies of the Earthlings like onion
peelers or two women in a bargain basement. One Venusian looked at the
other Venusian, and in a high-pitched, hoarse, sad voice said: ""Aye,
aye, aye--THIS--HIT SHOODEN HEPPEN TO A DOG--NOT A DOIDY LEEDLE DOG!""
And dawn came peacefully, like beer barrels, rolling.

_The Intruder_

_emil petaja_


It was in San Francisco, on the walk above the sand and surf that
pounded like the heart of the earth. There was wind, the sky and sea
blended in a grey mist.

I was sitting on a stone bench watching a faint hint of distant smoke,
wondering what ship it was and from what far port.

Mine was a pleasent wind--loneliness. So when he came, wrapped in his
great overcoat and muffler, hat pulled down, and sat on my bench I was
about to rise and leave him. There were other benches, and I was not in
the mood for idle gossip about Hitler and taxes.

""Don't go. Please."" His plea was authentic.

""I must get back to my shop,"" I said.

""Surely you can spare a moment."" I could not even to begin to place the
accent in his voice. Low as a whisper, tense. His deep-set eyes held
me ... his face was pale and had a serenity born of suffering. A placcid
face, not given to emotional betrayels, yet mystical. I sat down again.
Here was someone bewilderingly strange. Someone I wouldn't soon forget.
He moved a hand toward me, as tho to hold me from going, and I saw with
mild curiosity that he wore heavy gloves, like mittens.

""I am not well. I ... I must not be out in the damp air,"" I said. ""But
today I just had to go out and walk. I had to.""

""I can understand."" I warmed to the wave of aloneness that lay in his
words. ""I too have been ill. I know you, Otis Marlin. I have visited
your shop off Market Street. You are not rich, but the feel of the
covers on a fine book between your hands suffices. Am I right?""

I nodded, ""But how....""

""You have tried writing, but have had no success. Alone in the world,
your loneliness has much a family man, harassed might envy.""

""That's true,"" I admitted, wondering if he could be a seer, a fake
mystic bent on arousing in me an interest in spiritism favorable to his
pocket-book. His next words were a little amused, but he didn't smile.

""No, I'm not a psychic--in the ordinary sense, I've visited your shop. I
was there only yesterday,"" he said. And I remembered him. In returning
from my lunch I had met him coming out of my humble place of business.
One glimpse into those brooding eyes was not a thing to soon forget, and
I recalled pausing to watch his stiff-legged progress down the street
and around the corner.

There was now a pause, while I watched leaves scuttling along the oiled
walk in the growling wind. Then a sound like a sigh came from my
companion. It seemed to me that the wind and the sea spoke loudly of a
sudden, as tho approaching some dire climax. The sea wind chilled me as
it had not before, I wanted to leave.

""Dare I tell you? DARE I!"" His white face turned upward. It was as
though he questioned some spirit in the winds.

I was silent; curious, yet fearful of what it might be he might not be
allowed to tell me. The winds were portentously still.

""Were you ever told, as a child, that you must not attempt to count the
stars in the sky at night--that if you did you might _lose your mind_?""

""Why, yes. I believe I've heard that old superstition. Very reasonable,
I believe; based on the assumption that the task would be too great for
one brain. I....""

""I suppose it never occurred to you,"" he interrupted, ""that this
superstition might hold even more truth than that, truth as malignant as
it is vast. Perhaps the cosmos hold secrets beyond comprehension of man;
and what is your assurance that these secrets are beneficent and kind?
Is nature rather not terrible, than kind? In the stars are
patterns--designs which if read, might lure the intrepid miserable one
who reads them out of earth and beyond ... beyond, to immeasurable
evil.... Do you understand what I am saying?"" His voice quivered
metallically, was vibrant with emotion.

I tried to smile, but managed only a sickly grin. ""I understand you,
sir, but I am not in the habit of accepting nebulous theories such as
that without any shred of evidence.""

""There is, sad to say, only too much evidence. But do you believe that
men have _lost their minds_ from incessant study of the stars?""

""Perhaps some have, I don't know,"" I returned. ""But in the South of this
state in one of the country's leading observatories, I have a friend who
is famous as an astronomer. He is as sane as you or I. If not saner."" I
tacked the last sentence on with significant emphasis.

The fellow was muttering something into his muffler, and I fancied I
caught the words ""danger ..."" and ""fools ..."" We were silent again. Low
dark clouds fled over the roaring sea and the gloom intensified.
",futuria,bradbury,1940,1,844
"
Presently, in his clipt speech, the stranger said, ""Do you believe that
life exists on other planets, other stars? Have you ever wondered what
kind of life might inhabit the other stars in this solar system, and
those beyond it?"" His eyes were near mine as he spoke, and they
bewitched me. There was something in them, something intangible and
awful. I sensed that he was questioning me idly, as an outlander might
be questioned about things with which the asker is familiar, as I might
ask a New Yorker, ""What do you think of the Golden Gate Bridge?""

""I wouldn't attempt to guess, to describe, for instance, a Martian man,""
I said. ""Yet I read with interest various guesses by writers of
fiction."" I was striving to maintain a mood of lightness and ease, but
inwardly I felt a bitter cold, as one on the rim of a nightmare. I
suddenly realized, with childish fear, that night was falling.

""Writers of fiction! And what if they were to _guess too well_? What
then? Is it safe for them to have full rein over their imaginations?
Like the star-gazers...."" I said nothing, but smiled.

""Perhaps, man, there have been those whose minds were acute beyond most
earthly minds--those who have guessed too closely to truth. Perhaps
_those who are Beyond_ are not yet ready to make themselves known to
Earthlings? And maybe THEY, are annoyed with the puny publicity they
receive from imaginative writers.... Ask yourself, _what is
imagination_? Are earth-minds capable of conceiving that which is not
and has never been; or is this imagination merely a deeper insight
into worlds you know not of, worlds glimpsed dimly in the throes of
dream? And whence come these dreams? Tell me, have you ever awakened
from a dream with the sinister feeling that all was not well
inside your mind?--that while you, the real you, were away in
Limbo--_someone_--some_thing_ was probing in your mind, invading it and
reading it. Might not THEY leave behind them in departure shadowy
trailings of _their_ own minds?""

Now I was indeed speechless. For a strange nothing had started my
neck-hairs to prickling. Authors who might have guessed too well....
Two, no three, writers whose stories had hinted at inconceivable yet
inevitable dooms; writers I had known; had recently died, by accident.

""What of old legends? Of the serpent who shall one day devour the sun.
That legend dates back to Mu and Atlantis. Who, man, was and is Satan?
Christ? And Jehovah? benevolent and all-saving, were but a monstrous
jest fostered by THEY to keep man blindly content, and keep him divided
among himself so that he strove not to unravel the stars?""

""Man, in my foolish youth I studied by candleflame secrets that would
scorch your very soul. Of women who with their own bare hands have
strangled the children they bore so that the world might not know....
Disease and sickness at which physicians throw up their hands in
helpless bafflement. When strong men tear at their limbs and heads and
agony--seeking to drive forth alien forces that have netted themselves
into their bodies. I need scarcely recount them all, each with its own
abominable significance. It is THEM. Who are eternal and nameless, who
send their scouts down to test earth-man. Don't you realize that they
have watched man creep out of primal slimes, take limbs and shamble, and
finally walk? And that they are waiting, biding their time...."" I
shivered with a fear beyond name. I tried to laugh and could not. Then,
bold with stark horror, I shouted quite loudly: ""How do you know this?
Are you one of THEM?"" He shook his head violently. ""No, no!"" I made as
to go, feeling an aching horror within me.

""Stay only a moment more, man. I will have pity on you and will not tell
you all. I will not describe _them_. And I will not assay that which,
when upon first seeing you here by the sea, _I first intended_...."" I
listened. Not daring to look at him; as in the grip of daemonaic dream.
My fingers clutched at the edges of the bench so tightly that I have
been unable to write with them until now. He concluded thus:

""So you see that I am everywhere a worldless alien. Sometimes this
secret is too great for one mind to contain, and I must talk. I must
feel the presence of someone human near me, else I shall attempt to
commit suicide and again fail. It is without end--my horror. Have pity
on me, man of earth, as I have had pity on you.""

It was then that I gripped him by the shoulders and looked with pleading
desperation into his staring eyes. ""Why have you told me? What--"" My
voice broke. My hands fell to my sides. I shuddered.

He understood. Shrieked one word: ""PITY!"" into my insensible ear, and
was gone.

That was 3 nites ago and each nite since has been hell. I cannot
remember how long it was after the STRANGER left that I found myself
able to move, to rise, hobble home, suddenly ancient with knowledge. And
I cannot--WILL NOT--reveal to you all that I heard.

I thot myself insane, but after an examination, a physician pronounced
me that I had been strained mentally. I am competent. But I wonder if he
is wrong.

I view the silken stars tonight with loathing. HE sought to master their
inscrutable secret meaning, and succeeded. He imagined, he dreamed; and
he fed his sleep with potions, so that he might learn where his mind
might be during sleep, and himself probe into the mind that wandered
from space into his resting body-shell. I am no scientist, no
bio-chemist, so I learned little of his methods. Only that he did
succeed in removing his mind from Earth, and soaring to some remote
world over and beyond this universe--where THEY dwell. And THEY knew him
to be a mind of Earth, he told me. He but hinted of the evil he beheld,
so potent with dread that it shattered his mind. And THEY cured him, and
sent him back to earth.... ""They are waiting!"" he shrieked, in his
grating skeleton of a voice. ""They are contemptuous of man and his
feeble colonies. But they fear that some day, like an overgrown idiot
child, he may do them harm. But before this time--when Man has
progressed into a ripeness--THEY will descend! Then they will come in
hordes to exploit the world as THEY did before!""

Of his return, and his assuming the role of a man, the Alien spoke
evasively. It was to be assurred that this talk of his was not some
repulsive caprice; to know that all of it was true, that I gripped him
and beheld him. To my everlasting horror, I must know. Little in itself,
what I saw, but sufficient to cause me to sink down on the stone bench
in a convulsive huddle of fear. Never again in life can I tear this
clutching terror from my soul. Only this: That when I looked into his
staring eyes in the dimness of murky twilight, and before he understood
and quickly avaunted, I glimpsed with astoundment and repugnance that
between the muffling of his coat and black scarf _the INTRUDER wore a
meticulously painted metal mask--to hide what I must not see_....

ASPHODEL:

by E. T. PINE


    Down where skies are always dark,
    Where is ever heard the bark
    Of monstrous ebon hounds of hell,
    In a dreadful fearsome knell,
    Never fading, ever bright,
    With a weird and spectral light,
    Blooms a flower of ancient days,
    Shining in a crimson maze;
    When the black bat shrilly screams
    Asphodel, you haunt my dreams--

    From the lands of distant death
    Steals the perfume of your breath:

    Some night soon the wind will blow
    Saffron seeds to fall and grow
    By my casement window, where,
    Sleeps my loved one, still and fair;
    Then, the night you are to bloom
    I shall creep from out my room,
    From your blossom by the wall
    Shall I hear her dear voice call:
    Mournfully the wind will cry,
    And shadows cover all the sky--
    My lips will touch the loved dead
    When where you nod I lay my head....




MARMOK

by Emil Pataja


    Sleep that doth harbour a dream of dread,
    Whence come the fingers that beckoned and led
    My dream-stung soul from my canopied bed--
    Whither dost take me, ere I am dead?
    Beyond the skull-grinning mid-March moon
    Over the phosphorous-lit lagoon
    Out past the darkest pits of the night,
    Fast thru the stars in this evil flight;
    Lead thee me out past the rim of space,
    Show me that ravenous, pain-black face,
    Marmok, whose myrmidons ever are questing
    For souls who wander at nite, unresting.
    Then shall I know an ultimate bliss
    Tasting the fury of that cosmic kiss,
    Whilst my earth-cloak lies limply on the floor
    To waken and gibber forevermore.

What is the dim monstrosity that shimmers across the stars, what hand is
that to cradle planets, earth and mars. What misshapen gargantuan of
nebulous formed flesh, hurls out its flood of darkness, the systems to
enmesh. What is it walks across the universes chanting cosmic choruses
with endless verses--what thing unutterable has visited our Earth long
years ago, and now, tonite, returns, in the shadows lurking glow. What
ancient fear is with me, cold and terrible? Is that the shape of man
upon the constellations, blotting out the light--or something gasping in
hideous delight, plucking at the planets in insanity, at play, causing
suns to boil like cauldrons, meteors to sing upon their way with
mournful voices, lost ghosts upon lonely trails--wailing--wailing. Is
tonight our rendezvous with the Cosmos Thing, the Colossus bigger than
Andromeda that sits upon the throne of space--or are these fantasies
upon my aged eyes?




HADES

[Illustration]


    Upon the shores of molten seas stand men, stand men alone,

    And down below, in the molten flow, in the waves that cry and moan

    Are women bare with flaming hair, whose passions have no surcease.

    And in the air, midst the scarlet glare, are more who will never
    know Peace.




THE BEST WAYS TO GET AROUND


I don't mean socially; I mean off the Earth and between the planets.
There are a few really good ways, as invented by perspiring authors in
science-fiction magazines. And if I miss any, which is extremely
doubtful, remember that I'm writting from memory, that I hadn't read
_all_ the scientifiction magazines from 1926 and on, and that I am not
going to go researching through the tremendous stacks of old
scientifiction magazines that I now have in my possession.

Now, what DO I mean by THE BEST WAYS TO GET AROUND? Briefly, by the word
BEST, I mean so pseudo-logical that you could almost leave off the
""pseudo"". See? (No)

For instance, Jack Williamson's geodesic machinery, wherein he warps
space around, appeals to me as being pure fairy tale stuff. He just
gives a lot of verbal hocus-pocus, and runs off reams of litterary
fertilizer until we throw up our hands in disgust and say; ""O.K., O.K.,
Jack, to hell with that, let's get on with the 'story'. We'll grant you
that you _can_ get around.""--And we're willing to grant E.E. Smith the
same privilege. He _DOES_ get around--anybody disagree? The question is;
how? Oh, by useing ""X"", and the inertialess drive. The same with brother
Burroughs. What do we care if dear old John Carter ""yearns"" himself to
Mars? He gets there, and we are happy, or were happy.

So, we exclude all those from THE BEST WAYS TO GET AROUND. They are very
nice and convenient to get people places; but, when we run across one of
the ""BEST WAYS"" we often wonder if it REALLY WOULDN'T be possible,
provided----. Of course, that word ""provided"" is the catch--the reason
why we really aren't going around that way.
",futuria,bradbury,1940,1,764
"
Again--So, way back there, Edmond Hamilton, and a hundred others, have
used the idea of _light-preasure_ in an attempt to get away from
rockets. But he didn't tell us how, scientifictionaly. In direct
contrast to vauge statements made regarding the use of _light-preasure_
as propulsion, I remember the MOON CONQUORS, by R.H. Romans, in a 1931
(I think) (You're right, 4SJ) quarterly. You've seen radiometers. The
things with black and white vanes placed in a vacuum. The theory is that
the opposite shades cause unbalanced light preasure, so that the vanes
go around and around. Romans invented a pseudo-scientifically logical
way to use _light-preasure_, once he got his ship in space. His
scientist invented a compound of _absolute black_. (Which is also
obtainable in a darkroom) A small square of darkroom--or, I mean,
absolute black painted on the posterior of the ship, and regulated at
will, gave the same ship quite respectable speeds. Certainly it won't
work outside of a story--but, I'm talking scientifictionally. Romans
used his imagination, and we all had fun.

In the same story, Romans used a swell device to get the ship off the
earth. He used a mile-long tube, composed of circular magnets. It was a
_magnetic gun_. Each magnet pulled the ship towards it, and then, as the
ship passed it, the magnet's poles were reversed, and made to repel the
ship. With each magnet at maximum charge, either pulling or pushing the
ship, according to whether it was in front or behind the latter, the
same erupted from the tube with the necessary 7 M.P.S. velocity of
escape, and so was off on the way to the moon. What's wrong with the
idea? I dunno.

John W. Campell (Jr.) used to have brainstorms: in fact, he invented
_two_ of THE BEST WAYS TO GET AROUND. One, in the first of the ARCOT,
MOREY, and WADE stories, ""PIRACY PREFERRED"", was that of molecular
motion. All the little molecules in a bar of metal go madly around in
every possible direction. If you could invent, as Campbell did in the
story, an electro-magnetic vibration that would force all the mollecules
to go in the same direction, then the bar of metals would go in that
direction, since it would be them. So Mr. Campbell hooked the thing up
to his ship, and off he went to Venus, or some other planet. Well, it
_would_ work, wouldn't it, _provided_ (ah yes!) you could make all the
mollecules go into one directional flow.

And the other brainstorm was when Aarn Munro, in the MIGHTIEST MACHINE,
decided that momentum and velocity were wave formations, and therefore,
one should be able to _tune into them_! (Anyone should be able to think
up a simple theory like that.) Not a bad WAY TO GET AROUND--in a
science fiction story.

Back in 1930, or some such year, Charles R. Tanner wrote THE FLIGHT OF
THE MERCURY, in the old WONDER STORIES. In that story he told you just
how to go ahead and make an ETHERPROPELLER, provided there is such a
thing as ether, and Osmium B. The theory is: you use water screws, air
propellers, and so why not an ether propeller? Put a cork in motionless
water. Start a wave motion in the water with your hand. If the length of
the wave is greater than the diameter of the cork, the cork just bobs up
and down and stays where it is. If the lengths of the waves are shorter
than the diameter of the cork, the waves go around it, and the cork still
stays right where it is. If the length of the wave is exactly the
diameter of the cork, tho cork rides right off, in the trough of the
wave, at the same speed as that of the wave formation. Now invent an
electro-magnetic vibration--by useing the metal Osmium B--exactly the
length of a Copper atom. Make your ship of copper, putting the ether
propeller, that which causes vibration in the ether, at the end of the
ship, and presto! all the copper atoms move along in the trough of the
ether waves, at the same speed as the other waves, which is the speed of
light. And, Mr. Tanner is off for Mars, in a super-plausibly
scientifictional way.

HELL SHIP, in last year's ASTOUNDING, Arthur J. Burks put forth an idea
which had been discussed by engineers before he had ever used It. They
just didn't know how to do it. Mr. Burks did--didn't he write the story.
At least, the idea gave him more earthly benifit than it gave the
engineers. Maybe he thinks he invented it--I don't know, nor does it
matter: He used it, the idea of gravatic lines of force, forming a
spider web throughout the solar system. With the proper machinery,
which he ascribed with good attention to detail, you could crawl up
those lines of force like a spider. This idea is so plausable that it
might be placed in the same catagory as rocket propulsion, which is
fact.

THE MOTH, in this year's ASTOUNDING, contains another of those ideas of
interplanatary locomotion which I call one of THE BEST WAYS TO GET
AROUND. Don't worry, I'm not pointing to myself with pride. I just wrote
the story, Charles R. Tanner conceived the idea. He tossed it off
paranthetically one night, and promptly forgot about it. The idea----If
all objects are in motion, according to the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
contraction theory, lose length in the direction of motion, why couldn't
an artificialy produced cause instantaneous motion, why couldn't an
artificialy produced contraction cause instantaneous motion,
proportional to length-loss? Not a thing in the world against it, my
friends, all you have to do is to find a way to cause the artificial
contraction of the ship in question. Of course, in my story, I invented
a force-field----very handy when you're in a tight spot!----which caused
tho electrons to flatten out. This force acted on the ship and
everything within. Therefore, any speed up to a little below that of
light could be obtained, and that bogey man so often ignored in
scientifiction, acceleration, was disposed of at the start, since there
was nothing that had a tendancy to stay behind. There is the real
inertialess drive, which E.E. Smith talked of, but never used.

(Paranthetically: When Charles R. Tanner saw the story containing his
idea in print, he became enthused, and promptly invented and named all
machines used in the process, discovered a new and ultimate particle
called the ""graviton"", that which makes the proton 1846 times heavier
than the electron, and practically drew plans for the force field which
caused the contraction. When he finished we knew exactly _how_ to obtain
speeds far exceding both those of Smith and Campbell. Our inventions
were plausable, and they'd work, provided----)

I've just about reached the end of the list, though there are one or two
others that might be mentioned right here at the tail end of the
article. Jules Verne, I suppose, has to be credited with the first ship
fired from a canon, in ONCE AROUND THE MOON. Wells takes the bow for
gravity plates, which Willy Ley so neatly disposed of, only he called it
""cavorite"" in THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON., and Roy Cummings used it
effectivly in AROUND THE UNIVERSE (and a hundred others). In a story in
the old WONDER Donald Wolheim put his rocket ship on a huge wheel,
rotated the wheel and flung it off into space. Fair, except that the
acceleration would be killing.

AND THAT'S ABSOLUTLY ALL THE BEST WAYS TO GET AROUND. Unless there are
some of those which I haven't heard of. If you know of some, I would
like to be enlightened.

--THE SYMPHONIC ABDUCTION--


""I suppose you've heard about what happened to my brother Jerry?"" Ray
Spencer asked me; I shook my head. ""The whole family was worried about
him for a while: couldn't tell whether he had sleeping-sickness, or
what. All we knew was that he'd gone coma listening to some phonograph
records when he was alone in the house. Perhaps the intense emotional
effect of the music, plus its stentor, was the cause.

""When I returned home, he lay cold on the floor in front of the
radio-phonograph. The automatic release had shut off the record, but the
current was still on, and the volume dial was turned full strength.
Nothing I could do would rouse my brother, so--scared--I put him to bed
and called a doctor, who had him taken to a hospital for observation. No
one could determine what was the trouble, and since we couldn't afford
to keep him at the hospital indefinitely, we brought Jerry back home.
And although it wasn't exactly appropriate, I couldn't help remembering
the story of the Sleeping Beauty whenever I looked into his room and saw
him, apparently only napping.

""Then one day I heard him--still in his trance--whisperingly singing.
The indistinct notes were reminiscent of one of Chaikovsky's ballet
pieces. I tried vainly to wake him. He sighed on and on until the faint
breath of a voice softened into silence....

""When at last he did awake, I had been listening to some continental
communiques in the adjoining room, with the door open so that I could
look in on him in case of emergency. The program ended and was followed
by concert music. I don't care much for symphony, so I arose and went to
the radio to switch it off. At the same time, Jerry stirred: I heard his
bed creak. Turning to look his way, I twisted the wrong dial, and the
music thundered: my brother began to toss on his bed. Disregarding the
racket for a moment in excitement at seeing him move, I ran in to him,
shouting, shaking him a little. His hands groped, found mine, and clung
to them. Painfully he endeavored to raise himself, dropped back
perspiring and panting. Then he screamed--horribly!--as if all Hell's
devils were shovelling all Hell's coals on him, and opened his eyes, his
face taut with dread. He recognized me. In a moment I had soothed him
back to normalcy. He was perfectly all right from then on.

""Or at least we thought so. But since you're so interested in
metaphysics, get him to tell you about the vision he had during his
catalepsy. He won't feel embarrassed; he's told it to others. Just say
that I mentioned it to you."" Ray had finished. Later, when I chanced
upon Jerry Spencer, I brot him up to my apartment for dinner. The meal
over, he smiled at my query concerning his comatose dream, and related:

""None in my family are as interested in music as I: my belief is that to
realize its full magic you must leave off talking--better still, listen
to it alone--and, closing your eyes, open your mind to it. Relax--forget
yourself. All of my folks poke fun at me when I sit on the floor by the
radio during the concert broadcasts, my ears close to the speaker. But
that is the only way by which I can really enjoy music. The very
loudness, blasting at my hearing, emphasizes the tone-magic,
overwhelming everything else. And sometimes, if my eyes are shut, I can
see fantastic dream worlds, fiery pageants inspired by thundrous
harmonies.

""I had never dared to turn on the amplifier as loud as I'd have wished.
My family said that it would annoy the neighbors. So that day when I was
alone at home, I thot that then was my chance, if ever, and proceeded
to play my favorite record; the first scene of Chaikovsky's SWAN LAKE
ballet, as loudly as possible. The sound was not so deafening
as--maddening, or better still, intoxicating. How I Loved it! I sat
cross-legged, eyes shut, dreaming, at last absolutely happy. More:
ecstatic.

""The first notes were like an invitation emanating from a lost
dimension, calling me, wheedling. Promising haven, peace. The call of
the unknown: not the lure of dashing adventure but of mystery, mournful
sorcery, epic splendors....

""Deep in my heart there's a sort of innate Slavic sadness which
responded to the music's plaint, and my thought traveled with the melody
effortlessly on and on. The warm darkness of my closed eyes lightened to
infinities of cold, deep-blue emptiness, through which I felt myself
gliding as the theme progressed.

""Each harmonic burst, every wailing echo, dominated me. My thought was
borne farther and farther like a leaf in a tempest.... There were base
chords which made my throat quiver, and tears burned under my lowered
eyelids. I felt a tingling at my shoulders, and with eyes still closed
but discerning by a sort of dream-vision, I half-consciously turned,
beheld luminous yellow--draperies?--fluttering behind me, bouying me:
like scarf-wings, whipping comet-tails.

""An instinctive transient fright gripped me, admonishing me to withdraw
from this blue region into the calid darkness from which I had come--but
the melody's urge was stronger than my feeble urge to retreat. The azure
became flecked with diamond points of light which augmented into great
white moons, and from one to another in a vast network rayed pulsing
filaments, vascular channels of fluid light.

""A stupendous chorus of clear unhuman voices, as from diamond throats,
emanated from these linked moons, of which the music which had conveyed
me was only a distorted, ghostly echo.... In tangible waves this greater
music rippled around the webbed moons, beating against me as though to
force me away on its tides I know not whither.

""Beneath me was a limitless tract of grey slime which rose and fell
torpidly as with the breathing of a somnolent subterranean thing. The
moonlight burned brightly on it, and crawling across it from some remote
place came--trees?--snaky-rooted things whose prehensile branches bore,
instead of leaves, flexible lenses.... They left behind them red trails
on the slime, and excrementory ribbons of thin blue vapor streamed from
their topmost appendages. Occasionally they paused to feed, focussing
their lenses upon the gelatinous ground, which became luminously white
under the concentrated light. The sucking mouths of the serpentine roots
absorbed this matter, and red viscosity seeped into the eaten places,
greying rapidly under the moon's effulgence, chemically affected by it.

""And the trees mated. Gynandrous, they converged in pairs or groups,
pressing close together, thrusting their limbs into one enormous
cluster, aggregating their lenses into a series of complex, compact
forms ... shuddering with a violent ardor.... From erectile
protuberances rimming the lenses ruby liquid spurted, bursting with
incandescence under the condensed moonlight.

""Spent, drooping, the trees separated, and the radiant orgasmic matter
drifted lightly down to the slime, burning fitfully as the trees moved
away indifferently.

""Apparently these flickering radiances fed, for gradually they grew,
dulling, becoming opaque, substantial----thrusting out probing roots,
developing limbs, wandering like their parents. They snailed onward out
of sight, all of them.

""Silently, a phosphorescent green river raced like a bolt of furcate
lightning over the green wastes. It was composed not of water but of
myriad tiny luminous crawling insects. A conscious river, altering its
tortuous course at will, small streams deviating from the main body and
meandering erratically, then rejoining the general current. This river's
end drew into sight, flashed under me and into the distance, leaving
fast-greying red paths on the slime.

""The moon's music assailed me; simultaneously I felt those man-measures,
which had carried me so long, cease, leaving me without a link to my own
world--helpless against the inexorable tide of the lunar melody, which,
bursting more loudly, swept me higher, through an interstice of the
circulatory web, into blue infinity. And there it left me; fading
ripples of it would lap me, but were too dissapated then to sweep me
farther.

[Illustration]

Kramer leaned back. ""You can see the situation. How can we deal with a
factor like this? The perfect variable.""

""Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still
acts from necessity, the same as inanimate material. But the
cause-effect chain is more subtle; there are more factors to be
considered. The difference is quantitative, I think. The reaction of
the living organism parallels natural causation, but with greater
complexity.""

Gross and Kramer looked up at the board plates, suspended on the wall,
still dripping, the images hardening into place. Kramer traced a line
with his pencil.

""See that? It's a pseudopodium. They're alive, and so far, a weapon we
can't beat. No mechanical system can compete with that, simple or
intricate. We'll have to scrap the Johnson Control and find something
else.""

""Meanwhile the war continues as it is. Stalemate. Checkmate. They
can't get to us, and we can't get through their living minefield.""

Kramer nodded. ""It's a perfect defense, for them. But there still
might be one answer.""

""What's that?""

""Wait a minute."" Kramer turned to his rocket expert, sitting with the
charts and files. ""The heavy cruiser that returned this week. It
didn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no
contact.""

""Correct."" The expert nodded. ""The mine was twenty miles off. The
cruiser was in space-drive, moving directly toward Proxima,
line-straight, using the Johnson Control, of course. It had deflected
a quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown. Later it resumed its
course. That was when they got it.""

""It shifted,"" Kramer said. ""But not enough. The mine was coming along
after it, trailing it. It's the same old story, but I wonder about the
contact.""

""Here's our theory,"" the expert said. ""We keep looking for contact, a
trigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a
psychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative.
We're watching for something that isn't there. The mine _decides_ to
blow up. It sees our ship, approaches, and then decides.""

""Thanks."" Kramer turned to Gross. ""Well, that confirms what I'm
saying. How can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that
decides to explode? The whole theory of mine penetration is that you
must avoid tripping the trigger. But here the trigger is a state of
mind in a complicated, developed life-form.""

""The belt is fifty thousand miles deep,"" Gross added. ""It solves
another problem for them, repair and maintenance. The damn things
reproduce, fill up the spaces by spawning into them. I wonder what
they feed on?""

""Probably the remains of our first-line. The big cruisers must be a
delicacy. It's a game of wits, between a living creature and a ship
piloted by automatic relays. The ship always loses."" Kramer opened a
folder. ""I'll tell you what I suggest.""

""Go on,"" Gross said. ""I've already heard ten solutions today. What's
yours?""

""Mine is very simple. These creatures are superior to any mechanical
system, but only because they're alive. Almost any other life-form
could compete with them, any higher life-form. If the yuks can put out
living mines to protect their planets, we ought to be able to harness
some of our own life-forms in a similar way. Let's make use of the
same weapon ourselves.""

""Which life-form do you propose to use?""

""I think the human brain is the most agile of known living forms. Do
you know of any better?""

""But no human being can withstand outspace travel. A human pilot would
be dead of heart failure long before the ship got anywhere near
Proxima.""

""But we don't need the whole body,"" Kramer said. ""We need only the
brain.""

""What?""

""The problem is to find a person of high intelligence who would
contribute, in the same manner that eyes and arms are volunteered.""

""But a brain....""

""Technically, it could be done. Brains have been transferred several
times, when body destruction made it necessary. Of course, to a
spaceship, to a heavy outspace cruiser, instead of an artificial body,
that's new.""

The room was silent.

""It's quite an idea,"" Gross said slowly. His heavy square face
twisted. ""But even supposing it might work, the big question is
_whose_ brain?""

It was all very confusing, the reasons for the war, the nature of the
enemy. The Yucconae had been contacted on one of the outlying planets
of Proxima Centauri. At the approach of the Terran ship, a host of
dark slim pencils had lifted abruptly and shot off into the distance.
The first real encounter came between three of the yuk pencils and a
single exploration ship from Terra. No Terrans survived. After that it
was all out war, with no holds barred.

Both sides feverishly constructed defense rings around their systems.
Of the two, the Yucconae belt was the better. The ring around Proxima
was a living ring, superior to anything Terra could throw against it.
The standard equipment by which Terran ships were guided in outspace,
the Johnson Control, was not adequate. Something more was needed.
Automatic relays were not good enough.

--Not good at all, Kramer thought to himself, as he stood looking down
the hillside at the work going on below him. A warm wind blew along
the hill, rustling the weeds and grass. At the bottom, in the valley,
the mechanics had almost finished; the last elements of the reflex
system had been removed from the ship and crated up.

All that was needed now was the new core, the new central key that
would take the place of the mechanical system. A human brain, the
brain of an intelligent, wary human being. But would the human being
part with it? That was the problem.

Kramer turned. Two people were approaching him along the road, a man
and a woman. The man was Gross, expressionless, heavy-set, walking
with dignity. The woman was--He stared in surprise and growing
annoyance. It was Dolores, his wife. Since they'd separated he had
seen little of her....

""Kramer,"" Gross said. ""Look who I ran into. Come back down with us.
We're going into town.""

""Hello, Phil,"" Dolores said. ""Well, aren't you glad to see me?""

He nodded. ""How have you been? You're looking fine."" She was still
pretty and slender in her uniform, the blue-grey of Internal Security,
Gross' organization.

""Thanks."" She smiled. ""You seem to be doing all right, too. Commander
Gross tells me that you're responsible for this project, Operation
Head, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?""

""That's the problem."" Kramer lit a cigarette. ""This ship is to be
equipped with a human brain instead of the Johnson system. We've
constructed special draining baths for the brain, electronic relays to
catch the impulses and magnify them, a continual feeding duct that
supplies the living cells with everything they need. But--""

""But we still haven't got the brain itself,"" Gross finished. They
began to walk back toward the car. ""If we can get that we'll be ready
for the tests.""

""Will the brain remain alive?"" Dolores asked. ""Is it actually going to
live as part of the ship?""

""It will be alive, but not conscious. Very little life is actually
conscious. Animals, trees, insects are quick in their responses, but
they aren't conscious. In this process of ours the individual
personality, the ego, will cease. We only need the response ability,
nothing more.""

Dolores shuddered. ""How terrible!""

""In time of war everything must be tried,"" Kramer said absently. ""If
one life sacrificed will end the war it's worth it. This ship might
get through. A couple more like it and there wouldn't be any more
war.""
",mrspaceship,dick,1953,1,1271
"
They got into the car. As they drove down the road, Gross said, ""Have
you thought of anyone yet?""

Kramer shook his head. ""That's out of my line.""

""What do you mean?""

""I'm an engineer. It's not in my department.""

""But all this was your idea.""

""My work ends there.""

Gross was staring at him oddly. Kramer shifted uneasily.

""Then who is supposed to do it?"" Gross said. ""I can have my
organization prepare examinations of various kinds, to determine
fitness, that kind of thing--""

""Listen, Phil,"" Dolores said suddenly.

""What?""

She turned toward him. ""I have an idea. Do you remember that professor
we had in college. Michael Thomas?""

Kramer nodded.

""I wonder if he's still alive."" Dolores frowned. ""If he is he must be
awfully old.""

""Why, Dolores?"" Gross asked.

""Perhaps an old person who didn't have much time left, but whose mind
was still clear and sharp--""

""Professor Thomas."" Kramer rubbed his jaw. ""He certainly was a wise
old duck. But could he still be alive? He must have been seventy,
then.""

""We could find that out,"" Gross said. ""I could make a routine check.""

""What do you think?"" Dolores said. ""If any human mind could outwit
those creatures--""

""I don't like the idea,"" Kramer said. In his mind an image had
appeared, the image of an old man sitting behind a desk, his bright
gentle eyes moving about the classroom. The old man leaning forward, a
thin hand raised--

""Keep him out of this,"" Kramer said.

""What's wrong?"" Gross looked at him curiously.

""It's because _I_ suggested it,"" Dolores said.

""No."" Kramer shook his head. ""It's not that. I didn't expect anything
like this, somebody I knew, a man I studied under. I remember him very
clearly. He was a very distinct personality.""

""Good,"" Gross said. ""He sounds fine.""

""We can't do it. We're asking his death!""

""This is war,"" Gross said, ""and war doesn't wait on the needs of the
individual. You said that yourself. Surely he'll volunteer; we can
keep it on that basis.""

""He may already be dead,"" Dolores murmured.

""We'll find that out,"" Gross said speeding up the car. They drove the
rest of the way in silence.

For a long time the two of them stood studying the small wood house,
overgrown with ivy, set back on the lot behind an enormous oak. The
little town was silent and sleepy; once in awhile a car moved slowly
along the distant highway, but that was all.

""This is the place,"" Gross said to Kramer. He folded his arms. ""Quite
a quaint little house.""

Kramer said nothing. The two Security Agents behind them were
expressionless.

Gross started toward the gate. ""Let's go. According to the check he's
still alive, but very sick. His mind is agile, however. That seems to
be certain. It's said he doesn't leave the house. A woman takes care
of his needs. He's very frail.""

They went down the stone walk and up onto the porch. Gross rang the
bell. They waited. After a time they heard slow footsteps. The door
opened. An elderly woman in a shapeless wrapper studied them
impassively.

""Security,"" Gross said, showing his card. ""We wish to see Professor
Thomas.""

""Why?""

""Government business."" He glanced at Kramer.

Kramer stepped forward. ""I was a pupil of the Professor's,"" he said.
""I'm sure he won't mind seeing us.""

The woman hesitated uncertainly. Gross stepped into the doorway. ""All
right, mother. This is war time. We can't stand out here.""

The two Security agents followed him, and Kramer came reluctantly
behind, closing the door. Gross stalked down the hall until he came to
an open door. He stopped, looking in. Kramer could see the white
corner of a bed, a wooden post and the edge of a dresser.

He joined Gross.

In the dark room a withered old man lay, propped up on endless
pillows. At first it seemed as if he were asleep; there was no motion
or sign of life. But after a time Kramer saw with a faint shock that
the old man was watching them intently, his eyes fixed on them,
unmoving, unwinking.

""Professor Thomas?"" Gross said. ""I'm Commander Gross of Security. This
man with me is perhaps known to you--""

The faded eyes fixed on Kramer.

""I know him. Philip Kramer.... You've grown heavier, boy."" The voice
was feeble, the rustle of dry ashes. ""Is it true you're married now?""

""Yes. I married Dolores French. You remember her."" Kramer came toward
the bed. ""But we're separated. It didn't work out very well. Our
careers--""

""What we came here about, Professor,"" Gross began, but Kramer cut him
off with an impatient wave.

""Let me talk. Can't you and your men get out of here long enough to
let me talk to him?""

Gross swallowed. ""All right, Kramer."" He nodded to the two men. The
three of them left the room, going out into the hall and closing the
door after them.

The old man in the bed watched Kramer silently. ""I don't think much of
him,"" he said at last. ""I've seen his type before. What's he want?""

""Nothing. He just came along. Can I sit down?"" Kramer found a stiff
upright chair beside the bed. ""If I'm bothering you--""

""No. I'm glad to see you again, Philip. After so long. I'm sorry your
marriage didn't work out.""

""How have you been?""

""I've been very ill. I'm afraid that my moment on the world's stage
has almost ended."" The ancient eyes studied the younger man
reflectively. ""You look as if you have been doing well. Like everyone
else I thought highly of. You've gone to the top in this society.""

Kramer smiled. Then he became serious. ""Professor, there's a project
we're working on that I want to talk to you about. It's the first ray
of hope we've had in this whole war. If it works, we may be able to
crack the yuk defenses, get some ships into their system. If we can do
that the war might be brought to an end.""

""Go on. Tell me about it, if you wish.""

""It's a long shot, this project. It may not work at all, but we have
to give it a try.""

""It's obvious that you came here because of it,"" Professor Thomas
murmured. ""I'm becoming curious. Go on.""
",mrspaceship,dick,1953,1,1056
"
After Kramer finished the old man lay back in the bed without
speaking. At last he sighed.

""I understand. A human mind, taken out of a human body."" He sat up a
little, looking at Kramer. ""I suppose you're thinking of me.""

Kramer said nothing.

""Before I make my decision I want to see the papers on this, the
theory and outline of construction. I'm not sure I like it.--For
reasons of my own, I mean. But I want to look at the material. If
you'll do that--""

""Certainly."" Kramer stood up and went to the door. Gross and the two
Security Agents were standing outside, waiting tensely. ""Gross, come
inside.""

They filed into the room.

""Give the Professor the papers,"" Kramer said. ""He wants to study them
before deciding.""

Gross brought the file out of his coat pocket, a manila envelope. He
handed it to the old man on the bed. ""Here it is, Professor. You're
welcome to examine it. Will you give us your answer as soon as
possible? We're very anxious to begin, of course.""

""I'll give you my answer when I've decided."" He took the envelope with
a thin, trembling hand. ""My decision depends on what I find out from
these papers. If I don't like what I find, then I will not become
involved with this work in any shape or form."" He opened the envelope
with shaking hands. ""I'm looking for one thing.""

""What is it?"" Gross said.

""That's my affair. Leave me a number by which I can reach you when
I've decided.""

Silently, Gross put his card down on the dresser. As they went out
Professor Thomas was already reading the first of the papers, the
outline of the theory.

Kramer sat across from Dale Winter, his second in line. ""What then?""
Winter said.

""He's going to contact us."" Kramer scratched with a drawing pen on
some paper. ""I don't know what to think.""

""What do you mean?"" Winter's good-natured face was puzzled.

""Look."" Kramer stood up, pacing back and forth, his hands in his
uniform pockets. ""He was my teacher in college. I respected him as a
man, as well as a teacher. He was more than a voice, a talking book.
He was a person, a calm, kindly person I could look up to. I always
wanted to be like him, someday. Now look at me.""

""So?""

""Look at what I'm asking. I'm asking for his life, as if he were some
kind of laboratory animal kept around in a cage, not a man, a teacher
at all.""

""Do you think he'll do it?""

""I don't know."" Kramer went to the window. He stood looking out. ""In a
way, I hope not.""

""But if he doesn't--""

""Then we'll have to find somebody else. I know. There would be
somebody else. Why did Dolores have to--""

The vidphone rang. Kramer pressed the button.

""This is Gross."" The heavy features formed. ""The old man called me.
Professor Thomas.""

""What did he say?"" He knew; he could tell already, by the sound of
Gross' voice.

""He said he'd do it. I was a little surprised myself, but apparently
he means it. We've already made arrangements for his admission to the
hospital. His lawyer is drawing up the statement of liability.""

Kramer only half heard. He nodded wearily. ""All right. I'm glad. I
suppose we can go ahead, then.""

""You don't sound very glad.""

""I wonder why he decided to go ahead with it.""

""He was very certain about it."" Gross sounded pleased. ""He called me
quite early. I was still in bed. You know, this calls for a
celebration.""

""Sure,"" Kramer said. ""It sure does.""

Toward the middle of August the project neared completion. They stood
outside in the hot autumn heat, looking up at the sleek metal sides of
the ship.

Gross thumped the metal with his hand. ""Well, it won't be long. We can
begin the test any time.""

""Tell us more about this,"" an officer in gold braid said. ""It's such
an unusual concept.""

""Is there really a human brain inside the ship?"" a dignitary asked, a
small man in a rumpled suit. ""And the brain is actually alive?""
",mrspaceship,dick,1953,1,699
"
""Gentlemen, this ship is guided by a living brain instead of the usual
Johnson relay-control system. But the brain is not conscious. It will
function by reflex only. The practical difference between it and the
Johnson system is this: a human brain is far more intricate than any
man-made structure, and its ability to adapt itself to a situation, to
respond to danger, is far beyond anything that could be artificially
built.""

Gross paused, cocking his ear. The turbines of the ship were beginning
to rumble, shaking the ground under them with a deep vibration. Kramer
was standing a short distance away from the others, his arms folded,
watching silently. At the sound of the turbines he walked quickly
around the ship to the other side. A few workmen were clearing away
the last of the waste, the scraps of wiring and scaffolding. They
glanced up at him and went on hurriedly with their work. Kramer
mounted the ramp and entered the control cabin of the ship. Winter was
sitting at the controls with a Pilot from Space-transport.

""How's it look?"" Kramer asked.

""All right."" Winter got up. ""He tells me that it would be best to take
off manually. The robot controls--"" Winter hesitated. ""I mean, the
built-in controls, can take over later on in space.""

""That's right,"" the Pilot said. ""It's customary with the Johnson
system, and so in this case we should--""

""Can you tell anything yet?"" Kramer asked.

""No,"" the Pilot said slowly. ""I don't think so. I've been going over
everything. It seems to be in good order. There's only one thing I
wanted to ask you about."" He put his hand on the control board. ""There
are some changes here I don't understand.""

""Changes?""

""Alterations from the original design. I wonder what the purpose is.""

Kramer took a set of the plans from his coat. ""Let me look."" He turned
the pages over. The Pilot watched carefully over his shoulder.

""The changes aren't indicated on your copy,"" the Pilot said. ""I
wonder--"" He stopped. Commander Gross had entered the control cabin.

""Gross, who authorized alterations?"" Kramer said. ""Some of the wiring
has been changed.""

""Why, your old friend."" Gross signaled to the field tower through the
window.

""My old friend?""

""The Professor. He took quite an active interest."" Gross turned to the
Pilot. ""Let's get going. We have to take this out past gravity for the
test they tell me. Well, perhaps it's for the best. Are you ready?""

""Sure."" The Pilot sat down and moved some of the controls around.
""Anytime.""

""Go ahead, then,"" Gross said.

""The Professor--"" Kramer began, but at that moment there was a
tremendous roar and the ship leaped under him. He grasped one of the
wall holds and hung on as best he could. The cabin was filling with a
steady throbbing, the raging of the jet turbines underneath them.

The ship leaped. Kramer closed his eyes and held his breath. They were
moving out into space, gaining speed each moment.

""Well, what do you think?"" Winter said nervously. ""Is it time yet?""

""A little longer,"" Kramer said. He was sitting on the floor of the
cabin, down by the control wiring. He had removed the metal
covering-plate, exposing the complicated maze of relay wiring. He was
studying it, comparing it to the wiring diagrams.

""What's the matter?"" Gross said.

""These changes. I can't figure out what they're for. The only pattern
I can make out is that for some reason--""

""Let me look,"" the Pilot said. He squatted down beside Kramer. ""You
were saying?""

""See this lead here? Originally it was switch controlled. It closed
and opened automatically, according to temperature change. Now it's
wired so that the central control system operates it. The same with
the others. A lot of this was still mechanical, worked by pressure,
temperature, stress. Now it's under the central master.""

""The brain?"" Gross said. ""You mean it's been altered so that the brain
manipulates it?""

Kramer nodded. ""Maybe Professor Thomas felt that no mechanical relays
could be trusted. Maybe he thought that things would be happening too
fast. But some of these could close in a split second. The brake
rockets could go on as quickly as--""

""Hey,"" Winter said from the control seat. ""We're getting near the moon
stations. What'll I do?""

They looked out the port. The corroded surface of the moon gleamed up
at them, a corrupt and sickening sight. They were moving swiftly toward
it.
",mrspaceship,dick,1953,1,748
"
""I'll take it,"" the Pilot said. He eased Winter out of the way and
strapped himself in place. The ship began to move away from the moon
as he manipulated the controls. Down below them they could see the
observation stations dotting the surface, and the tiny squares that
were the openings of the underground factories and hangars. A red
blinker winked up at them and the Pilot's fingers moved on the board
in answer.

""We're past the moon,"" the Pilot said, after a time. The moon had
fallen behind them; the ship was heading into outer space. ""Well, we
can go ahead with it.""

Kramer did not answer.

""Mr. Kramer, we can go ahead any time.""

Kramer started. ""Sorry. I was thinking. All right, thanks."" He
frowned, deep in thought.

""What is it?"" Gross asked.

""The wiring changes. Did you understand the reason for them when you
gave the okay to the workmen?""

Gross flushed. ""You know I know nothing about technical material. I'm
in Security.""

""Then you should have consulted me.""

""What does it matter?"" Gross grinned wryly. ""We're going to have to
start putting our faith in the old man sooner or later.""

The Pilot stepped back from the board. His face was pale and set.
""Well, it's done,"" he said. ""That's it.""

""What's done?"" Kramer said.

""We're on automatic. The brain. I turned the board over to it--to him,
I mean. The Old Man."" The Pilot lit a cigarette and puffed nervously.
""Let's keep our fingers crossed.""

The ship was coasting evenly, in the hands of its invisible pilot. Far
down inside the ship, carefully armoured and protected, a soft human
brain lay in a tank of liquid, a thousand minute electric charges
playing over its surface. As the charges rose they were picked up and
amplified, fed into relay systems, advanced, carried on through the
entire ship--

Gross wiped his forehead nervously. ""So _he_ is running it, now. I
hope he knows what he's doing.""

Kramer nodded enigmatically. ""I think he does.""

""What do you mean?""

""Nothing."" Kramer walked to the port. ""I see we're still moving in a
straight line."" He picked up the microphone. ""We can instruct the
brain orally, through this."" He blew against the microphone
experimentally.

""Go on,"" Winter said.

""Bring the ship around half-right,"" Kramer said. ""Decrease speed.""

They waited. Time passed. Gross looked at Kramer. ""No change.
Nothing.""

""Wait.""

Slowly, the ship was beginning to turn. The turbines missed, reducing
their steady beat. The ship was taking up its new course, adjusting
itself. Nearby some space debris rushed past, incinerating in the
blasts of the turbine jets.

""So far so good,"" Gross said.

They began to breathe more easily. The invisible pilot had taken
control smoothly, calmly. The ship was in good hands. Kramer spoke a
few more words into the microphone, and they swung again. Now they
were moving back the way they had come, toward the moon.

""Let's see what he does when we enter the moon's pull,"" Kramer said.
""He was a good mathematician, the old man. He could handle any kind of
problem.""

The ship veered, turning away from the moon. The great eaten-away
globe fell behind them.

Gross breathed a sigh of relief. ""That's that.""

""One more thing."" Kramer picked up the microphone. ""Return to the moon
and land the ship at the first space field,"" he said into it.

""Good Lord,"" Winter murmured. ""Why are you--""

""Be quiet."" Kramer stood, listening. The turbines gasped and roared as
the ship swung full around, gaining speed. They were moving back, back
toward the moon again. The ship dipped down, heading toward the great
globe below.

""We're going a little fast,"" the Pilot said. ""I don't see how he can
put down at this velocity.""

The port filled up, as the globe swelled rapidly. The Pilot hurried
toward the board, reaching for the controls. All at once the ship
jerked. The nose lifted and the ship shot out into space, away from
the moon, turning at an oblique angle. The men were thrown to the
floor by the sudden change in course. They got to their feet again,
speechless, staring at each other.

The Pilot gazed down at the board. ""It wasn't me! I didn't touch a
thing. I didn't even get to it.""

The ship was gaining speed each moment. Kramer hesitated. ""Maybe you
better switch it back to manual.""

The Pilot closed the switch. He took hold of the steering controls and
moved them experimentally. ""Nothing."" He turned around. ""Nothing. It
doesn't respond.""

No one spoke.

""You can see what has happened,"" Kramer said calmly. ""The old man
won't let go of it, now that he has it. I was afraid of this when I
saw the wiring changes. Everything in this ship is centrally
controlled, even the cooling system, the hatches, the garbage release.
We're helpless.""

""Nonsense."" Gross strode to the board. He took hold of the wheel and
turned it. The ship continued on its course, moving away from the
moon, leaving it behind.

""Release!"" Kramer said into the microphone. ""Let go of the controls!
We'll take it back. Release.""

""No good,"" the Pilot said. ""Nothing."" He spun the useless wheel. ""It's
dead, completely dead.""

""And we're still heading out,"" Winter said, grinning foolishly. ""We'll
be going through the first-line defense belt in a few minutes. If they
don't shoot us down--""

""We better radio back."" The Pilot clicked the radio to _send_. ""I'll
contact the main bases, one of the observation stations.""

""Better get the defense belt, at the speed we're going. We'll be into
it in a minute.""

""And after that,"" Kramer said, ""we'll be in outer space. He's moving
us toward outspace velocity. Is this ship equipped with baths?""

""Baths?"" Gross said.
",mrspaceship,dick,1953,1,963
"
    He fixed things--clocks, refrigerators, vidsenders and
    destinies. But he had no business in the future, where the
    calculators could not handle him. He was Earth's only
    hope--and its sure failure!


Security Commissioner Reinhart rapidly climbed the front steps and
entered the Council building. Council guards stepped quickly aside and
he entered the familiar place of great whirring machines. His thin
face rapt, eyes alight with emotion, Reinhart gazed intently up at the
central SRB computer, studying its reading.

""Straight gain for the last quarter,"" observed Kaplan, the lab
organizer. He grinned proudly, as if personally responsible. ""Not bad,
Commissioner.""

""We're catching up to them,"" Reinhart retorted. ""But too damn slowly.
We must finally go over--and soon.""

Kaplan was in a talkative mood. ""We design new offensive weapons, they
counter with improved defenses. And nothing is actually made!
Continual improvement, but neither we nor Centaurus can stop designing
long enough to stabilize for production.""

""It will end,"" Reinhart stated coldly, ""as soon as Terra turns out a
weapon for which Centaurus can build no defense.""

""Every weapon has a defense. Design and discord. Immediate
obsolescence. Nothing lasts long enough to--""

""What we count on is the _lag_,"" Reinhart broke in, annoyed. His hard
gray eyes bored into the lab organizer and Kaplan slunk back. ""The
time lag between our offensive design and their counter development.
The lag varies."" He waved impatiently toward the massed banks of SRB
machines. ""As you well know.""

At this moment, 9:30 AM, May 7, 2136, the statistical ratio on the SRB
machines stood at 21-17 on the Centauran side of the ledger. All facts
considered, the odds favored a successful repulsion by Proxima
Centaurus of a Terran military attack. The ratio was based on the
total information known to the SRB machines, on a gestalt of the vast
flow of data that poured in endlessly from all sectors of the Sol and
Centaurus systems.

21-17 on the Centauran side. But a month ago it had been 24-18 in the
enemy's favor. Things were improving, slowly but steadily. Centaurus,
older and less virile than Terra, was unable to match Terra's rate of
technocratic advance. Terra was pulling ahead.

""If we went to war now,"" Reinhart said thoughtfully, ""we would lose.
We're not far enough along to risk an overt attack."" A harsh, ruthless
glow twisted across his handsome features, distorting them into a
stern mask. ""But the odds are moving in our favor. Our offensive
designs are gradually gaining on their defenses.""

""Let's hope the war comes soon,"" Kaplan agreed. ""We're all on edge.
This damn waiting....""

The war would come soon. Reinhart knew it intuitively. The air was
full of tension, the _elan_. He left the SRB rooms and hurried down
the corridor to his own elaborately guarded office in the Security
wing. It wouldn't be long. He could practically feel the hot breath of
destiny on his neck--for him a pleasant feeling. His thin lips set in
a humorless smile, showing an even line of white teeth against his
tanned skin. It made him feel good, all right. He'd been working at it
a long time.

First contact, a hundred years earlier, had ignited instant conflict
between Proxima Centauran outposts and exploring Terran raiders. Flash
fights, sudden eruptions of fire and energy beams.

And then the long, dreary years of inaction between enemies where
contact required years of travel, even at nearly the speed of light.
The two systems were evenly matched. Screen against screen. Warship
against power station. The Centauran Empire surrounded Terra, an iron
ring that couldn't be broken, rusty and corroded as it was. Radical
new weapons had to be conceived, if Terra was to break out.

Through the windows of his office, Reinhart could see endless
buildings and streets, Terrans hurrying back and forth. Bright specks
that were commute ships, little eggs that carried businessmen and
white-collar workers around. The huge transport tubes that shot masses
of workmen to factories and labor camps from their housing units. All
these people, waiting to break out. Waiting for the day.

Reinhart snapped on his vidscreen, the confidential channel. ""Give me
Military Designs,"" he ordered sharply.

He sat tense, his wiry body taut, as the vidscreen warmed into life.
Abruptly he was facing the hulking image of Peter Sherikov, director
of the vast network of labs under the Ural Mountains.

Sherikov's great bearded features hardened as he recognized Reinhart.
His bushy black eyebrows pulled up in a sullen line. ""What do you
want? You know I'm busy. We have too much work to do, as it is.
Without being bothered by--politicians.""

""I'm dropping over your way,"" Reinhart answered lazily. He adjusted
the cuff of his immaculate gray cloak. ""I want a full description of
your work and whatever progress you've made.""

""You'll find a regular departmental report plate filed in the usual
way, around your office someplace. If you'll refer to that you'll know
exactly what we--""

""I'm not interested in that. I want to _see_ what you're doing. And I
expect you to be prepared to describe your work fully. I'll be there
shortly. Half an hour.""

Reinhart cut the circuit. Sherikov's heavy features dwindled and
faded. Reinhart relaxed, letting his breath out. Too bad he had to
work with Sherikov. He had never liked the man. The big Polish
scientist was an individualist, refusing to integrate himself with
society. Independent, atomistic in outlook. He held concepts of the
individual as an end, diametrically contrary to the accepted organic
state Weltansicht.

But Sherikov was the leading research scientist, in charge of the
Military Designs Department. And on Designs the whole future of Terra
depended. Victory over Centaurus--or more waiting, bottled up in the
Sol System, surrounded by a rotting, hostile Empire, now sinking into
ruin and decay, yet still strong.

Reinhart got quickly to his feet and left the office. He hurried down
the hall and out of the Council building.

A few minutes later he was heading across the mid-morning sky in his
highspeed cruiser, toward the Asiatic land-mass, the vast Ural
mountain range. Toward the Military Designs labs.

Sherikov met him at the entrance. ""Look here, Reinhart. Don't think
you're going to order me around. I'm not going to--""

""Take it easy."" Reinhart fell into step beside the bigger man. They
passed through the check and into the auxiliary labs. ""No immediate
coercion will be exerted over you or your staff. You're free to
continue your work as you see fit--for the present. Let's get this
straight. My concern is to integrate your work with our total social
needs. As long as your work is sufficiently productive--""
",variableman,dick,1953,1,1106
"
Reinhart stopped in his tracks.

""Pretty, isn't he?"" Sherikov said ironically.

""What the hell is it?

""Icarus, we call him. Remember the Greek myth? The legend of Icarus.
Icarus flew.... This Icarus is going to fly, one of these days.""
Sherikov shrugged. ""You can examine him, if you want. I suppose this
is what you came here to see.""

Reinhart advanced slowly. ""This is the weapon you've been working on?""

""How does he look?""

Rising up in the center of the chamber was a squat metal cylinder, a
great ugly cone of dark gray. Technicians circled around it, wiring up
the exposed relay banks. Reinhart caught a glimpse of endless tubes
and filaments, a maze of wires and terminals and parts criss-crossing
each other, layer on layer.

""What is it?"" Reinhart perched on the edge of a workbench, leaning his
big shoulders against the wall. ""An idea of Jamison Hedge--the same
man who developed our instantaneous interstellar vidcasts forty years
ago. He was trying to find a method of faster than light travel when
he was killed, destroyed along with most of his work. After that ftl
research was abandoned. It looked as if there were no future in it.""

""Wasn't it shown that nothing could travel faster than light?""

""The interstellar vidcasts do! No, Hedge developed a valid ftl drive.
He managed to propel an object at fifty times the speed of light. But
as the object gained speed, its length began to diminish and its mass
increased. This was in line with familiar twentieth-century concepts
of mass-energy transformation. We conjectured that as Hedge's object
gained velocity it would continue to lose length and gain mass until
its length became nil and its mass infinite. Nobody can imagine such
an object.""

""Go on.""

""But what actually occurred is this. Hedge's object continued to lose
length and gain mass until it reached the theoretical limit of
velocity, the speed of light. At that point the object, still gaining
speed, simply ceased to exist. Having no length, it ceased to occupy
space. It disappeared. However, the object had not been _destroyed_.
It continued on its way, gaining momentum each moment, moving in an
arc across the galaxy, away from the Sol system. Hedge's object
entered some other realm of being, beyond our powers of conception.
The next phase of Hedge's experiment consisted in a search for some
way to slow the ftl object down, back to a sub-ftl speed, hence back
into our universe. This counterprinciple was eventually worked out.""

""With what result?""

""The death of Hedge and destruction of most of his equipment. His
experimental object, in re-entering the space-time universe, came into
being in space already occupied by matter. Possessing an incredible
mass, just below infinity level, Hedge's object exploded in a titanic
cataclysm. It was obvious that no space travel was possible with such
a drive. Virtually all space contains _some_ matter. To re-enter space
would bring automatic destruction. Hedge had found his ftl drive and
his counterprinciple, but no one before this has been able to put them
to any use.""

Reinhart walked over toward the great metal cylinder. Sherikov jumped
down and followed him. ""I don't get it,"" Reinhart said. ""You said the
principle is no good for space travel.""

""That's right.""

""What's this for, then? If the ship explodes as soon as it returns to
our universe--""

""This is not a ship."" Sherikov grinned slyly. ""Icarus is the first
practical application of Hedge's principles. Icarus is a bomb.""

""So this is our weapon,"" Reinhart said. ""A bomb. An immense bomb.""

""A bomb, moving at a velocity greater than light. A bomb which will
not exist in our universe. The Centaurans won't be able to detect or
stop it. How could they? As soon as it passes the speed of light it
will cease to exist--beyond all detection.""

""But--""

""Icarus will be launched outside the lab, on the surface. He will
align himself with Proxima Centaurus, gaining speed rapidly. By the
time he reaches his destination he will be traveling at ftl-100.
Icarus will be brought back to this universe within Centaurus itself.
The explosion should destroy the star and wash away most of its
planets--including their central hub-planet, Armun. There is no way
they can halt Icarus, once he has been launched. No defense is
possible. Nothing can stop him. It is a real fact.""

""When will he be ready?""

Sherikov's eyes flickered. ""Soon.""

""Exactly how soon?""

The big Pole hesitated. ""As a matter of fact, there's only one thing
holding us back.""

Sherikov led Reinhart around to the other side of the lab. He pushed a
lab guard out of the way.

""See this?"" He tapped a round globe, open at one end, the size of a
grapefruit. ""This is holding us up.""

""What is it?""

""The central control turret. This thing brings Icarus back to sub-ftl
flight at the correct moment. It must be absolutely accurate. Icarus
will be within the star only a matter of a microsecond. If the turret
does not function exactly, Icarus will pass out the other side and
shoot beyond the Centauran system.""

""How near completed is this turret?""

Sherikov hedged uncertainly, spreading out his big hands. ""Who can
say? It must be wired with infinitely minute equipment--microscope
grapples and wires invisible to the naked eye.""

""Can you name any completion date?""

Sherikov reached into his coat and brought out a manila folder. ""I've
drawn up the data for the SRB machines, giving a date of completion.
You can go ahead and feed it. I entered ten days as the maximum
period. The machines can work from that.""

Reinhart accepted the folder cautiously. ""You're sure about the date?
I'm not convinced I can trust you, Sherikov.""

Sherikov's features darkened. ""You'll have to take a chance,
Commissioner. I don't trust you any more than you trust me. I know how
much you'd like an excuse to get me out of here and one of your
puppets in.""

Reinhart studied the huge scientist thoughtfully. Sherikov was going
to be a hard nut to crack. Designs was responsible to Security, not
the Council. Sherikov was losing ground--but he was still a potential
danger. Stubborn, individualistic, refusing to subordinate his welfare
to the general good.

""All right."" Reinhart put the folder slowly away in his coat. ""I'll
feed it. But you better be able to come through. There can't be any
slip-ups. Too much hangs on the next few days.""

""If the odds change in our favor are you going to give the
mobilization order?""

""Yes,"" Reinhart stated. ""I'll give the order the moment I see the odds
change.""
",variableman,dick,1953,1,1107
"
Standing in front of the machines, Reinhart waited nervously for the
results. It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The day was warm, a
pleasant May afternoon. Outside the building the daily life of the
planet went on as usual.

As usual? Not exactly. The feeling was in the air, an expanding
excitement growing every day. Terra had waited a long time. The attack
on Proxima Centaurus had to come--and the sooner the better. The
ancient Centauran Empire hemmed in Terra, bottled the human race up in
its one system. A vast, suffocating net draped across the heavens,
cutting Terra off from the bright diamonds beyond.... And it had to
end.

The SRB machines whirred, the visible combination disappearing. For a
time no ratio showed. Reinhart tensed, his body rigid. He waited.

The new ratio appeared.

Reinhart gasped. 7-6. Toward Terra!

Within five minutes the emergency mobilization alert had been flashed
to all Government departments. The Council and President Duffe had
been called to immediate session. Everything was happening fast.

But there was no doubt. 7-6. In Terra's favor. Reinhart hurried
frantically to get his papers in order, in time for the Council
session.

At histo-research the message plate was quickly pulled from the
confidential slot and rushed across the central lab to the chief
official.

""Look at this!"" Fredman dropped the plate on his superior's desk.
""Look at it!""

Harper picked up the plate, scanning it rapidly. ""Sounds like the real
thing. I didn't think we'd live to see it.""

Fredman left the room, hurrying down the hall. He entered the time
bubble office. ""Where's the bubble?"" he demanded, looking around.

One of the technicians looked slowly up. ""Back about two hundred
years. We're coming up with interesting data on the War of 1914.
According to material the bubble has already brought up--""

""Cut it. We're through with routine work. Get the bubble back to the
present. From now on all equipment has to be free for Military work.""

""But--the bubble is regulated automatically.""

""You can bring it back manually.""

""It's risky."" The technician hedged. ""If the emergency requires it, I
suppose we could take a chance and cut the automatic.""

""The emergency requires _everything_,"" Fredman said feelingly.

""But the odds might change back,"" Margaret Duffe, President of the
Council, said nervously. ""Any minute they can revert.""

""This is our chance!"" Reinhart snapped, his temper rising. ""What the
hell's the matter with you? We've waited years for this.""

The Council buzzed with excitement. Margaret Duffe hesitated
uncertainly, her blue eyes clouded with worry. ""I realize the
opportunity is here. At least, statistically. But the new odds have
just appeared. How do we know they'll last? They stand on the basis of
a single weapon.""

""You're wrong. You don't grasp the situation."" Reinhart held himself
in check with great effort. ""Sherikov's weapon tipped the ratio in our
favor. But the odds have been moving in our direction for months. It
was only a question of time. The new balance was inevitable, sooner or
later. It's not just Sherikov. He's only one factor in this. It's all
nine planets of the Sol System--not a single man.""

One of the Councilmen stood up. ""The President must be aware the
entire planet is eager to end this waiting. All our activities for the
past eighty years have been directed toward--""

Reinhart moved close to the slender President of the Council. ""If you
don't approve the war, there probably will be mass rioting. Public
reaction will be strong. Damn strong. And you know it.""

Margaret Duffe shot him a cold glance. ""You sent out the emergency
order to force my hand. You were fully aware of what you were doing.
You knew once the order was out there'd be no stopping things.""

A murmur rushed through the Council, gaining volume. ""We have to
approve the war!... We're committed!... It's too late to turn back!""

Shouts, angry voices, insistent waves of sound lapped around Margaret
Duffe. ""I'm as much for the war as anybody,"" she said sharply. ""I'm
only urging moderation. An inter-system war is a big thing. We're
going to war because a machine says we have a statistical chance of
winning.""

""There's no use starting the war unless we can win it,"" Reinhart said.
""The SRB machines tell us whether we can win.""

""They tell us our _chance_ of winning. They don't guarantee anything.""

""What more can we ask, beside a good chance of winning?""

Margaret Duffe clamped her jaw together tightly. ""All right. I hear
all the clamor. I won't stand in the way of Council approval. The vote
can go ahead."" Her cold, alert eyes appraised Reinhart. ""Especially
since the emergency order has already been sent out to all Government
departments.""

""Good."" Reinhart stepped away with relief. ""Then it's settled. We can
finally go ahead with full mobilization.""

Mobilization proceeded rapidly. The next forty-eight hours were alive
with activity.

Reinhart attended a policy-level Military briefing in the Council
rooms, conducted by Fleet Commander Carleton.

""You can see our strategy,"" Carleton said. He traced a diagram on the
blackboard with a wave of his hand. ""Sherikov states it'll take eight
more days to complete the ftl bomb. During that time the fleet we have
near the Centauran system will take up positions. As the bomb goes off
the fleet will begin operations against the remaining Centauran ships.
Many will no doubt survive the blast, but with Armun gone we should be
able to handle them.""

Reinhart took Commander Carleton's place. ""I can report on the
economic situation. Every factory on Terra is converted to arms
production. With Armun out of the way we should be able to promote
mass insurrection among the Centauran colonies. An inter-system Empire
is hard to maintain, even with ships that approach light speed. Local
war-lords should pop up all over the place. We want to have weapons
available for them and ships starting _now_ to reach them in time.
Eventually we hope to provide a unifying principle around which the
colonies can all collect. Our interest is more economic than
political. They can have any kind of government they want, as long as
they act as supply areas for us. As our eight system planets act now.""

Carleton resumed his report. ""Once the Centauran fleet has been
scattered we can begin the crucial stage of the war. The landing of
men and supplies from the ships we have waiting in all key areas
throughout the Centauran system. In this stage--""

Reinhart moved away. It was hard to believe only two days had passed
since the mobilization order had been sent out. The whole system was
alive, functioning with feverish activity. Countless problems were
being solved--but much remained.
",variableman,dick,1953,1,1120
"
He entered the lift and ascended to the SRB room, curious to see if
there had been any change in the machines' reading. He found it the
same. So far so good. Did the Centaurans know about Icarus? No doubt;
but there wasn't anything they could do about it. At least, not in
eight days.

Kaplan came over to Reinhart, sorting a new batch of data that had
come in. The lab organizer searched through his data. ""An amusing item
came in. It might interest you."" He handed a message plate to
Reinhart.

It was from histo-research:

                            May 9, 2136

    This is to report that in bringing the research time bubble up
    to the present the manual return was used for the first time.
    Therefore a clean break was not made, and a quantity of
    material from the past was brought forward. This material
    included an individual from the early twentieth century who
    escaped from the lab immediately. He has not yet been taken
    into protective custody. Histo-research regrets this incident,
    but attributes it to the emergency.

                                                        E. Fredman

Reinhart handed the plate back to Kaplan. ""Interesting. A man from the
past--hauled into the middle of the biggest war the universe has
seen.""

""Strange things happen. I wonder what the machines will think.""

""Hard to say. Probably nothing."" Reinhart left the room and hurried
along the corridor to his own office.

As soon as he was inside he called Sherikov on the vidscreen, using
the confidential line.

The Pole's heavy features appeared. ""Good day, Commissioner. How's the
war effort?""

""Fine. How's the turret wiring proceeding?""

A faint frown flickered across Sherikov's face. ""As a matter of fact,
Commissioner--""

""What's the matter?"" Reinhart said sharply.

Sherikov floundered. ""You know how these things are. I've taken my
crew off it and tried robot workers. They have greater dexterity, but
they can't make decisions. This calls for more than mere dexterity.
This calls for--"" He searched for the word. ""--for an _artist_.""

Reinhart's face hardened. ""Listen, Sherikov. You have eight days left
to complete the bomb. The data given to the SRB machines contained
that information. The 7-6 ratio is based on that estimate. If you
don't come through--""

Sherikov twisted in embarrassment. ""Don't get excited, Commissioner.
We'll complete it.""

""I hope so. Call me as soon as it's done."" Reinhart snapped off the
connection. If Sherikov let them down he'd have him taken out and
shot. The whole war depended on the ftl bomb.

The vidscreen glowed again. Reinhart snapped it on. Kaplan's face
formed on it. The lab organizer's face was pale and frozen.
""Commissioner, you better come up to the SRB office. Something's
happened.""

""What is it?""

""I'll show you.""

Alarmed, Reinhart hurried out of his office and down the corridor. He
found Kaplan standing in front of the SRB machines. ""What's the
story?"" Reinhart demanded. He glanced down at the reading. It was
unchanged.

Kaplan held up a message plate nervously. ""A moment ago I fed this
into the machines. After I saw the results I quickly removed it. It's
that item I showed you. From histo-research. About the man from the
past.""

""What happened when you fed it?""

Kaplan swallowed unhappily. ""I'll show you. I'll do it again. Exactly
as before."" He fed the plate into a moving intake belt. ""Watch the
visible figures,"" Kaplan muttered.

Reinhart watched, tense and rigid. For a moment nothing happened. 7-6
continued to show. Then--

The figures disappeared. The machines faltered. New figures showed
briefly. 4-24 for Centaurus. Reinhart gasped, suddenly sick with
apprehension. But the figures vanished. New figures appeared. 16-38
for Centaurus. Then 48-86. 79-15 in Terra's favor. Then nothing. The
machines whirred, but nothing happened.
",variableman,dick,1953,1,616
"
Nothing at all. No figures. Only a blank.

""What's it mean?"" Reinhart muttered, dazed.

""It's fantastic. We didn't think this could--""

""_What's happened?_""

""The machines aren't able to handle the item. No reading can come.
It's data they can't integrate. They can't use it for prediction
material, and it throws off all their other figures.""

""Why?""

""It's--it's a variable."" Kaplan was shaking, white-lipped and pale.
""Something from which no inference can be made. The man from the past.
The machines can't deal with him. The variable man!""




Thomas Cole was sharpening a knife with his whetstone when the tornado
hit.

The knife belonged to the lady in the big green house. Every time Cole
came by with his Fixit cart the lady had something to be sharpened.
Once in awhile she gave him a cup of coffee, hot black coffee from an
old bent pot. He liked that fine; he enjoyed good coffee.

The day was drizzly and overcast. Business had been bad. An automobile
had scared his two horses. On bad days less people were outside and he
had to get down from the cart and go to ring doorbells.

But the man in the yellow house had given him a dollar for fixing his
electric refrigerator. Nobody else had been able to fix it, not even
the factory man. The dollar would go a long way. A dollar was a lot.

He knew it was a tornado even before it hit him. Everything was
silent. He was bent over his whetstone, the reins between his knees,
absorbed in his work.

He had done a good job on the knife; he was almost finished. He spat
on the blade and was holding it up to see--and then the tornado came.

All at once it was there, completely around him. Nothing but grayness.
He and the cart and horses seemed to be in a calm spot in the center
of the tornado. They were moving in a great silence, gray mist
everywhere.

And while he was wondering what to do, and how to get the lady's knife
back to her, all at once there was a bump and the tornado tipped him
over, sprawled out on the ground. The horses screamed in fear,
struggling to pick themselves up. Cole got quickly to his feet.

_Where was he?_

The grayness was gone. White walls stuck up on all sides. A deep light
gleamed down, not daylight but something like it. The team was pulling
the cart on its side, dragging it along, tools and equipment falling
out. Cole righted the cart, leaping up onto the seat.

And for the first time saw the people.

Men, with astonished white faces, in some sort of uniforms. Shouts,
noise and confusion. And a feeling of danger!

Cole headed the team toward the door. Hoofs thundered steel against
steel as they pounded through the doorway, scattering the astonished
men in all directions. He was out in a wide hall. A building, like a
hospital.

The hall divided. More men were coming, spilling from all sides.

Shouting and milling in excitement, like white ants. Something cut
past him, a beam of dark violet. It seared off a corner of the cart,
leaving the wood smoking.

Cole felt fear. He kicked at the terrified horses. They reached a big
door, crashing wildly against it. The door gave--and they were
outside, bright sunlight blinking down on them. For a sickening second
the cart tilted, almost turning over. Then the horses gained speed,
racing across an open field, toward a distant line of green, Cole
holding tightly to the reins.

Behind him the little white-faced men had come out and were standing
in a group, gesturing frantically. He could hear their faint shrill
shouts.

But he had got away. He was safe. He slowed the horses down and began
to breathe again.

The woods were artificial. Some kind of park. But the park was wild
and overgrown. A dense jungle of twisted plants. Everything growing in
confusion.

The park was empty. No one was there. By the position of the sun he
could tell it was either early morning or late afternoon. The smell of
the flowers and grass, the dampness of the leaves, indicated morning.
It had been late afternoon when the tornado had picked him up. And the
sky had been overcast and cloudy.

Cole considered. Clearly, he had been carried a long way. The
hospital, the men with white faces, the odd lighting, the accented
words he had caught--everything indicated he was no longer in
Nebraska--maybe not even in the United States.

Some of his tools had fallen out and gotten lost along the way. Cole
collected everything that remained, sorting them, running his fingers
over each tool with affection. Some of the little chisels and wood
gouges were gone. The bit box had opened, and most of the smaller bits
had been lost. He gathered up those that remained and replaced them
tenderly in the box. He took a key-hole saw down, and with an oil rag
wiped it carefully and replaced it.

Above the cart the sun rose slowly in the sky. Cole peered up, his
horny hand over his eyes. A big man, stoop-shouldered, his chin gray
and stubbled. His clothes wrinkled and dirty. But his eyes were clear,
a pale blue, and his hands were finely made.
",variableman,dick,1953,1,895
"
_It's hard to ferret out a gang of fanatics; it would, obviously, be
even harder to spot a genetic line of dedicated men. But the problem
Orne had was one step tougher than that!_


When the Investigation & Adjustment scout cruiser landed on Marak it
carried a man the doctors had no hope of saving. He was alive only
because he was in a womblike creche pod that had taken over most of his
vital functions.

The man's name was Lewis Orne. He had been a blocky, heavy-muscled
redhead with slightly off-center features and the hard flesh of a heavy
planet native. Even in the placid repose of near death there was
something clownish about his appearance. His burned, ungent-covered face
looked made up for some bizarre show.

Marak is the League capital, and the I-A medical center there is
probably the best in the galaxy, but it accepted the creche pod and Orne
more as a curiosity than anything else. The man had lost one eye, three
fingers of his left hand and part of his hair, suffered a broken jaw and
various internal injuries. He had been in terminal shock for more than
ninety hours.

Umbo Stetson, Orne's section chief, went back into his cruiser's
""office"" after a hospital flitter took pod and patient. There was an
added droop to Stetson's shoulders that accentuated his usual slouching
stance. His overlarge features were drawn into ridges of sorrow. A
general straggling, trampish look about him was not helped by patched
blue fatigues.

The doctor's words still rang in Stetson's ears: ""This patient's vital
tone is too low to permit operative replacement of damaged organs. He'll
live for a while because of the pod, but--"" And the doctor had shrugged.

Stetson slumped into his desk chair, looked out the open port beside
him. Some four hundred meters below, the scurrying beetlelike activity
of the I-A's main field sent up discordant roaring and clattering. Two
rows of other scout cruisers were parked in line with Stetson's
port--gleaming red and black needles. He stared at them without really
seeing them.

_It always happens on some ""routine"" assignment_, he thought. _Nothing
but a slight suspicion about Heleb: the fact that only women held high
office. One simple, unexplained fact ... and I lose my best agent!_

He sighed, turned to his desk, began composing the report:

""The militant core on the Planet Heleb has been eliminated. Occupation
force on the ground. No further danger to Galactic peace expected from
this source. Reason for operation: Rediscovery & Re-education--_after
two years on the planet_--failed to detect signs of militancy. The major
indications were: 1) a ruling caste restricted to women, and 2)
disparity between numbers of males and females _far_ beyond the Lutig
norm! Senior Field Agent Lewis Orne found that the ruling caste was
controlling the sex of offspring at conception (see attached details),
and had raised a male slave army to maintain its rule. The R&R agent had
been drained of information, then killed. Arms constructed on the basis
of that information caused critical injuries to Senior Field Agent Orne.
He is not expected to live. I am hereby urging that he receive the
Galaxy Medal, and that his name be added to the Roll of Honor.""

Stetson pushed the page aside. That was enough for ComGO, who never read
anything but the first page anyway. Details were for his aides to chew
and digest. They could wait. Stetson punched his desk callbox for Orne's
service record, set himself to the task he most detested: notifying next
of kin. He read, pursing his lips:

""Home Planet: Chargon. Notify in case of accident or death: Mrs.
Victoria Orne, mother.""

He leafed through the pages, reluctant to send the hated message. Orne
had enlisted in the Marak Marines at age seventeen--a runaway from
home--and his mother had given post-enlistment consent. Two years later:
scholarship transfer to Uni-Galacta, the R&R school here on Marak. Five
years of school and one R&R field assignment under his belt, and he had
been drafted into the I-A for brilliant detection of militancy on
Hammel. And two years later--_kaput_!

Abruptly, Stetson hurled the service record at the gray metal wall
across from him; then he got up, brought the record back to his desk,
smoothing the pages. There were tears in his eyes. He flipped a switch
on his desk, dictated the notification to Central Secretarial, ordered
it sent out priority. Then he went groundside and got drunk on Hochar
Brandy, Orne's favorite drink.

The next morning there was a reply from Chargon: ""Lewis Orne's mother
too ill to travel. Sisters being notified. Please ask Mrs. Ipscott
Bullone of Marak, wife of the High Commissioner, to take over for
family."" It was signed: ""Madrena Orne Standish, sister.""

With some misgivings, Stetson called the residence of Ipscott Bullone,
leader of the majority party in the Marak Assembly. Mrs. Bullone took
the call with blank screen. There was a sound of running water in the
background. Stetson stared at the grayness swimming in his desk visor.
He always disliked a blank screen. A baritone husk of a voice slid:
""This is Polly Bullone.""

Stetson introduced himself, relayed the Chargon message.

""Victoria's boy dying? Here? Oh, the poor thing! And Madrena's back on
Chargon ... the election. Oh, yes, of course. I'll get right over to the
hospital!""

Stetson signed off, broke the contact.

_The High Commissioner's wife yet!_ he thought. Then, because he had to
do it, he walled off his sorrow, got to work.

At the medical center, the oval creche containing Orne hung from ceiling
hooks in a private room. There were humming sounds in the dim, watery
greenness of the room, rhythmic chuggings, sighings. Occasionally, a
door opened almost soundlessly, and a white-clad figure would check the
graph tapes on the creche's meters.
",haystack,herbert,1959,1,974
"
Orne was lingering. He became the major conversation piece at the
internes' coffee breaks: ""That agent who was hurt on Heleb, he's still
with us. Man, they must build those guys different from the rest of
us!... Yeah! Understand he's got only about an eighth of his insides ...
liver, kidneys, stomach--all gone.... Lay you odds he doesn't last out
the month.... Look what old sure-thing McTavish wants to bet on!""

On the morning of his eighty-eighth day in the creche, the day nurse
came into Orne's room, lifted the inspection hood, looked down at him.
The day nurse was a tall, lean-faced professional who had learned to
meet miracles and failures with equal lack of expression. However, this
routine with the dying I-A operative had lulled her into a state of
psychological unpreparedness. _Any day now, poor guy_, she thought. And
she gasped as she opened his sole remaining eye, said:

""Did they clobber those dames on Heleb?""

""Yes, sir!"" she blurted. ""They really did, sir!""

""Good!""

Orne closed his eye. His breathing deepened.

The nurse rang frantically for the doctors.

It had been an indeterminate period in a blank fog for Orne, then a time
of pain and the gradual realization that he was in a creche. Had to be.
He could remember his sudden exposure on Heleb, the explosion--then
nothing. Good old creche. It made him feel safe now, shielded from all
danger.

Orne began to show minute but steady signs of improvement. In another
month, the doctors ventured an intestinal graft that gave him a new
spurt of energy. Two months later, they replaced missing eye and
fingers, restored his scalp line, worked artistic surgery on his burn
scars.

Fourteen months, eleven days, five hours and two minutes after he had
been picked up ""as good as dead,"" Orne walked out of the hospital under
his own power, accompanied by a strangely silent Umbo Stetson.

Under the dark blue I-A field cape, Orne's coverall uniform fitted his
once muscular frame like a deflated bag. But the pixie light had
returned to his eyes--even to the eye he had received from a nameless
and long dead donor. Except for the loss of weight, he looked to be the
same Lewis Orne. If he was different--beyond the ""spare parts""--it was
something he only suspected, something that made the idea, ""twice-born,""
not a joke.

Outside the hospital, clouds obscured Marak's green sun. It was
midmorning. A cold spring wind bent the pile lawn, tugged fitfully at
the border plantings of exotic flowers around the hospital's landing
pad.

Orne paused on the steps above the pad, breathed deeply of the chill
air. ""Beautiful day,"" he said.

Stetson reached out a hand to help Orne down the steps, hesitated, put
the hand back in his pocket. Beneath the section chief's look of weary
superciliousness there was a note of anxiety. His big features were set
in a frown. The drooping eyelids failed to conceal a sharp, measuring
stare.

Orne glanced at the sky to the southwest. ""The flitter ought to be here
any minute."" A gust of wind tugged at his cape. He staggered, caught his
balance. ""I _feel_ good.""

""You look like something left over from a funeral,"" growled Stetson.

""Sure--my funeral,"" said Orne. He grinned. ""Anyway, I was getting tired
of that walk-around-type morgue. All my nurses were married.""

""I'd almost stake my life that I could trust you,"" muttered Stetson.

Orne looked at him. ""No, no, Stet ... stake _my_ life. I'm used to it.""

Stetson shook his head. ""No, dammit! I trust you, but you deserve a
peaceful convalescence. We've no right to saddle you with--""

""Stet?"" Orne's voice was low, amused.

""Huh?"" Stetson looked up.

""Let's save the noble act for someone who doesn't know you,"" said Orne.
""You've a job for me. O.K. You've made the gesture for your conscience.""

Stetson produced a wolfish grin. ""All right. So we're desperate, and we
haven't much time. In a nutshell, since you're going to be a house guest
at the Bullones'--we suspect Ipscott Bullone of being the head of a
conspiracy to take over the government.""

""What do you mean--_take over the government_?"" demanded Orne. ""The
Galactic High Commissioner _is_ the government--subject to the
Constitution and the Assemblymen who elected him.""

""We've a situation that could explode into another Rim War, and we think
he's at the heart of it,"" said Stetson. ""We've eighty-one touchy
planets, all of them old-line steadies that have been in the League for
years. And on every one of them we have reason to believe there's a clan
of traitors sworn to overthrow the League. Even on your home
planet--Chargon.""

""You want me to go home for my convalescence?"" asked Orne. ""Haven't been
there since I was seventeen. I'm not sure that--""

""No, dammit! We want you as the Bullones' house guest! And speaking of
that, would you mind explaining how they were chosen to ride herd on
you?""

""There's an odd thing,"" said Orne. ""All those gags in the I-A about old
Upshook Ipscott Bullone ... and then I find that his wife went to school
with my mother.""

""Have you met Himself?""

""He brought his wife to the hospital a couple of times.""

Again, Stetson looked to the southwest, then back to Orne. A pensive
look came over his face. ""Every schoolkid knows how the Nathians and the
Marakian League fought it out in the Rim War--how the old civilization
fell apart--and it all seems kind of distant,"" he said.

""Five hundred standard years,"" said Orne.

""And maybe no farther away than yesterday,"" murmured Stetson. He cleared
his throat.
",haystack,herbert,1959,1,939
"
And Orne wondered why Stetson was moving so cautiously. _Something deep
troubling him._ A sudden thought struck Orne. He said: ""You spoke of
trust. Has this conspiracy involved the I-A?""

""We think so,"" said Stetson. ""About a year ago, an R&R archeological
team was nosing around some ruins on Dabih. The place was all but
vitrified in the Rim War, but a whole bank of records from a Nathian
outpost escaped."" He glanced sidelong at Orne. ""The Rah&Rah boys
couldn't make sense out of the records. No surprise. They called in an
I-A crypt-analyst. He broke a complicated substitution cipher. When the
stuff started making sense he pushed the panic button.""

""For something the Nathians wrote five hundred years ago?""

Stetson's drooping eyelids lifted. There was a cold quality to his
stare. ""This was a routing station for key Nathian families,"" he said.
""Trained refugees. An old dodge ... been used as long as there've
been--""

""But five hundred _years_, Stet!""

""I don't care if it was five _thousand_ years!"" barked Stetson. ""We've
intercepted some scraps since then that were written in the _same_ code.
The bland confidence of _that_! Wouldn't that gall you?"" He shook his
head. ""And every scrap we've intercepted deals with the coming
elections.""

""But the election's only a couple of days off!"" protested Orne.

Stetson glanced at his wristchrono. ""Forty-two hours to be exact,"" he
said. ""Some deadline!""

""Any names in these old records?"" asked Orne.

Stetson nodded. ""Names of planets, yes. People, no. Some code names,
but no cover names. Code name on Chargon was _Winner_. That ring any
bells with you?""

Orne shook his head. ""No. What's the code name here?""

_""The Head,""_ said Stetson. ""But what good does that do us? They're sure
to've changed those by now.""

""They didn't change their communications code,"" said Orne.

""No ... they didn't.""

""We must have something on them, some leads,"" said Orne. He felt that
Stetson was holding back something vital.

""Sure,"" said Stetson. ""We have history books. They say the Nathians were
top drawer in political mechanics. We know for a fact they chose landing
sites for their _refugees_ with diabolical care. Each family was told to
dig in, grow up with the adopted culture, develop the weak spots, build
an underground, train their descendants to take over. They set out to
bore from within, to make victory out of defeat. The Nathians were long
on patience. They came originally from nomad stock on Nathia II. Their
mythology calls them Arbs or Ayrbs. Go review your seventh grade
history. You'll know almost as much as we do!""

""Like looking for the traditional needle in the haystack,"" muttered
Orne. ""How come you suspect High Commissioner Upshook?""

Stetson wet his lips with his tongue. ""One of the Bullones' seven
daughters is currently at home,"" he said. ""Name's Diana. A field leader
in the I-A women. One of the Nathian code messages we intercepted had
her name as addressee.""

""Who sent the message?"" asked Orne. ""What was it all about?""

Stetson coughed. ""You know, Lew, we cross-check everything. This message
was signed M.O.S. The only M.O.S. that came out of the comparison was on
a routine next-of-kin reply. We followed it down to the original copy,
and the handwriting checked. Name of Madrena Orne Standish.""

""Maddie?"" Orne froze, turned slowly to face Stetson. ""So that's what's
troubling you!""

""We know you haven't been home since you were seventeen,"" said Stetson.
""Your record with us is clean. The question is--""

""Permit me,"" said Orne. ""The question is: Will I turn in my own sister
if it falls that way?""

Stetson remained silent, staring at him.

""O.K.,"" said Orne. ""My job is seeing that we don't have another Rim War.
Just answer me one question: How's Maddie mixed up in this? My family
isn't one of these traitor clans.""

""This whole thing is all tangled up with politics,"" said Stetson. ""We
think it's because of her husband.""

""Ahhhh, the member for Chargon,"" said Orne. ""I've never met him."" He
looked to the southwest where a flitter was growing larger as it
approached. ""Who's my cover contact?""

""That mini-transceiver we planted in your neck for the Gienah job,""
said Stetson. ""It's still there and functioning. Anything happens around
you, we hear it.""

[Illustration]

Orne touched the subvocal stud at his neck, moved his speaking muscles
without opening his mouth. A surf-hissing voice filled the matching
transceiver in Stetson's neck:

_""You pay attention while I'm making a play for this Diana Bullone, you
hear? Then you'll know how an expert works.""_

""Don't get so interested in your work that you forget why you're out
there,"" growled Stetson.

Mrs. Bullone was a fat little mouse of a woman. She stood almost in the
center of the guest room of her home, hands clasped across the paunch of
a long, dull silver gown. She had demure gray eyes, grandmotherly gray
hair combed straight back in a jeweled net--and that shocking baritone
husk of a voice issuing from a small mouth. Her figure sloped out from
several chins to a matronly bosom, then dropped straight like a barrel.
The top of her head came just above Orne's dress epaulets.

""We want you to feel at home here, Lewis,"" she husked. ""You're to
consider yourself one of the family.""

Orne looked around at the Bullone guest room: low key furnishings with
an old-fashioned selectacol for change of decor. A polawindow looked out
onto an oval swimming pool, the glass muted to dark blue. It gave the
outside a moonlight appearance. There was a contour bed against one
wall, several built-ins, and a door partly open to reveal bathroom
tiles. Everything traditional and comfortable.

""I already _do_ feel at home,"" he said. ""You know, your house is very
like our place on Chargon. I was surprised when I saw it from the air.
Except for the setting, it looks almost identical.""

""I guess your mother and I shared ideas when we were in school,"" said
Polly. ""We were _very_ close friends.""

""You must've been to do all this for me,"" said Orne. ""I don't know how
I'm ever going to--""

""Ah! Here we are!"" A deep masculine voice boomed from the open door
behind Orne. He turned, saw Ipscott Bullone, High Commissioner of the
Marakian League. Bullone was tall, had a face of harsh angles and deep
lines, dark eyes under heavy brows, black hair trained in receding
waves. There was a look of ungainly clumsiness about him.

_He doesn't strike me as the dictator type_, thought Orne. _But that's
obviously what Stet suspects._
",haystack,herbert,1959,1,1099
"
""Glad you made it out all right, son,"" boomed Bullone. He advanced into
the room, glanced around. ""Hope everything's to your taste here.""

""Lewis was just telling me that our place is very like his mother's home
on Chargon,"" said Polly.

""It's old fashioned, but we like it,"" said Bullone. ""Just a great big
tetragon on a central pivot. We can turn any room we want to the sun,
the shade or the breeze, but we usually leave the main salon pointing
northeast. View of the capital, you know.""

""We have a sea breeze on Chargon that we treat the same way,"" said Orne.

""I'm sure Lewis would like to be left alone for a while now,"" said
Polly. ""This is his first day out of the hospital. We mustn't tire him.""
She crossed to the polawindow, adjusted it to neutral gray, turned the
selectacol, and the room's color dominance shifted to green. ""There,
that's more restful,"" she said. ""Now, if there's anything you need you
just ring the bell there by your bed. The autobutle will know where to
find us.""

The Bullones left, and Orne crossed to the window, looked out at the
pool. The young woman hadn't come back. When the chauffeur-driven
limousine flitter had dropped down to the house's landing pad, Orne had
seen a parasol and sunhat nodding to each other on the blue tiles beside
the pool. The parasol had shielded Polly Bullone. The sunhat had been
worn by a shapely young woman in swimming tights, who had rushed off
into the house.

She was no taller than Polly, but slender and with golden red hair
caught under the sunhat in a swimmer's chignon. She was not
beautiful--face too narrow with suggestions of Bullone's cragginess, and
the eyes overlarge. But her mouth was full-lipped, chin strong, and
there had been an air of exquisite assurance about her. The total effect
had been one of striking elegance--extremely feminine.

Orne looked beyond the pool: wooded hills and, dimly on the horizon, a
broken line of mountains. The Bullones lived in expensive isolation.
Around them stretched miles of wilderness, rugged with planned neglect.

_Time to report in_, he thought. Orne pressed the neck stud on his
transceiver, got Stetson, told him what had happened to this point.

""All right,"" said Stetson. ""Go find the daughter. She fits the
description of the gal you saw by the pool.""

""That's what I was hoping,"" said Orne.

He changed into light-blue fatigues, went to the door of his room, let
himself out into a hall. A glance at his wristchrono showed that it was
shortly before noon--time for a bit of scouting before they called
lunch. He knew from his brief tour of the house and its similarity to
the home of his childhood that the hall let into the main living salon.
The public rooms and men's quarters were in the outside ring. Secluded
family apartments and women's quarters occupied the inner section.

Orne made his way to the salon. It was long, built around two sections
of the tetragon, and with low divans beneath the view windows. The floor
was thick pile rugs pushed one against another in a crazy patchwork of
reds and browns. At the far end of the room, someone in blue fatigues
like his own was bent over a stand of some sort. The figure straightened
at the same time a tinkle of music filled the room. He recognized the
red-gold hair of the young woman he had seen beside the pool. She was
wielding two mallets to play a stringed instrument that lay on its side
supported by a carved-wood stand.

He moved up behind her, his footsteps muffled by the carpeting. The
music had a curious rhythm that suggested figures dancing wildly around
firelight. She struck a final chord, muted the strings.

""That makes me homesick,"" said Orne.

""Oh!"" She whirled, gasped, then smiled. ""You startled me. I thought I
was alone.""

""Sorry. I was enjoying the music.""

""I'm Diana Bullone,"" she said. ""You're Mr. Orne.""

""Lew to all of the Bullone family, I hope,"" he said.

""Of course ... Lew."" She gestured at the musical instrument. ""This is
very old. Most find its music ... well, rather weird. It's been handed
down for generations in mother's family.""

""The kaithra,"" said Orne. ""My sisters play it. Been a long time since
I've heard one.""

""Oh, of course,"" she said. ""Your mother's--"" She stopped, looked
confused. ""I've got to get used to the fact that you're.... I mean that
we have a strange man around the house who isn't _exactly_ strange.""

Orne grinned. In spite of the blue I-A fatigues and a rather severe
pulled-back hairdo, this was a handsome woman. He found himself liking
her, and this caused him a feeling near self-loathing. She was a
suspect. He couldn't afford to like her. But the Bullones were being so
decent, taking him in like this. And how was their hospitality being
repaid? By spying and prying. Yet, his first loyalty belonged to the
I-A, to the peace it represented.
",haystack,herbert,1959,1,847
"
He said rather lamely: ""I hope you get over the feeling that I'm
strange.""

""I'm over it already,"" she said. She linked arms with him, said: ""If you
feel up to it, I'll take you on the deluxe guided tour.""

By nightfall, Orne was in a state of confusion. He had found Diana
fascinating, and yet the most comfortable woman to be around that he had
ever met. She liked swimming, _paloika_ hunting, _ditar_ apples-- She
had a ""poo-poo"" attitude toward the older generation that she said she'd
never before revealed to anyone. They had laughed like fools over utter
nonsense.

Orne went back to his room to change for dinner, stopped before the
polawindow. The quick darkness of these low latitudes had pulled an ebon
blanket over the landscape. There was city-glow off to the left, and an
orange halo to the peaks where Marak's three moons would rise. _Am I
falling in love with this woman?_ he asked himself. He felt like calling
Stetson, not to report but just to talk the situation out. And this made
him acutely aware that Stetson or an aide had heard everything said
between them that afternoon.

The autobutle called dinner. Orne changed hurriedly into a fresh lounge
uniform, found his way to the small salon across the house. The Bullones
already were seated around an old-fashioned bubble-slot table set with
real candles, golden _shardi_ service. Two of Marak's moons could be
seen out the window climbing swiftly over the peaks.

""You turned the house,"" said Orne.

""We like the moonrise,"" said Polly. ""It seems more romantic, don't you
think?"" She glanced at Diana.

Diana looked down at her plate. She was wearing a low-cut gown of
_firemesh_ that set off her red hair. A single strand of _Reinach_
pearls gleamed at her throat.

Orne sat down in the vacant seat opposite her. _What a handsome woman!_
he thought.

Polly, on Orne's right, looked younger and softer in a green stola gown
that hazed her barrel contours. Bullone, across from her, wore black
lounging shorts and knee-length _kubi_ jacket of golden pearl cloth.
Everything about the people and setting reeked of wealth, power. For a
moment, Orne saw that Stetson's suspicions could have basis in fact.
Bullone might go to any lengths to maintain this luxury.

Orne's entrance had interrupted an argument between Polly and her
husband. They welcomed him, went right on without inhibition. Rather
than embarrassing him, this made him feel more at home, more accepted.

[Illustration]

""But I'm not running for office this time,"" said Bullone patiently. ""Why
do we have to clutter up the evening with that many people just to--""

""Our election night parties are traditional,"" said Polly.

""Well, I'd just like to relax quietly at home tomorrow,"" he said. ""Take
it easy with just the family here and not have to--""

""It's not like it was a _big_ party,"" said Polly. ""I've kept the list to
fifty.""

Diana straightened, said: ""This is an important election Daddy! How
could you _possibly_ relax? There're seventy-three seats in question ...
the whole balance. If things go wrong in just the Alkes sector ... why
... you could be sent back to the floor. You'd lose your job as ... why
... someone else could take over as--""

""Welcome to the job,"" said Bullone. ""It's a headache."" He grinned at
Orne. ""Sorry to burden you with this, m'boy, but the women of this
family run me ragged. I guess from what I hear that you've had a pretty
busy day, too."" He smiled paternally at Diana. ""And your first day out
of the hospital.""

""She sets quite a pace, but I've enjoyed it,"" said Orne.

""We're taking the small flitter for a tour of the wilderness area
tomorrow,"" said Diana. ""Lew can relax all the way. I'll do the driving.""

""Be sure you're back in plenty of time for the party,"" said Polly.
""Can't have--"" She broke off at a low bell from the alcove behind her.
""That'll be for me. Excuse me, please ... no, don't get up.""
",haystack,herbert,1959,1,679
"
Orne bent to his dinner as it came out of the bubble slot beside his
plate: meat in an exotic sauce, _Sirik_ champagne, _paloika au semil_
... more luxury.

Presently, Polly returned, resumed her seat.

""Anything important?"" asked Bullone.

""Only a cancellation for tomorrow night. Professor Wingard is ill.""

""I'd just as soon it was cancelled down to the four of us,"" said
Bullone.

_Unless this is a pose, this doesn't sound like a man who wants to grab
more power_, thought Orne.

""Scottie, you should take more pride in your office!"" snapped Polly.
""You're an important man.""

""If it weren't for you, I'd be a nobody and prefer it,"" said Bullone. He
grinned at Orne. ""I'm a political idiot compared to my wife. Never saw
anyone who could call the turn like she does. Runs in her family. Her
mother was the same way.""

Orne stared at him, fork raised from plate and motionless. A sudden idea
had exploded in his mind.

""You must know something of this life, Lewis,"" said Bullone. ""Your
father was member for Chargon once, wasn't he?""

""Yes,"" murmured Orne. ""But that was before I was born. He died in
office."" He shook his head, thought: _It couldn't be ... but--_

""Do you feel all right, Lew?"" asked Diana. ""You're suddenly so pale.""

""Just tired,"" said Orne. ""Guess I'm not used to so much activity.""

""And I've been a beast keeping you so busy today,"" she said.

""Don't you stand on ceremony here, son,"" said Polly. She looked
concerned. ""You've been very sick, and we understand. If you're tired,
you go right on into bed.""

Orne glanced around the table, met anxious attention in each face. He
pushed his chair back, said: ""Well, if you really don't mind--""

""Mind!"" barked Polly. ""You scoot along now!""

""See you in the morning. Lew,"" said Diana.

He nodded, turned away, thinking: _What a handsome woman!_ As he started
down the hall, he heard Bullone say to Diana: ""Di, perhaps you'd better
not take that boy out tomorrow. After all, he _is_ supposed to be here
for a rest."" Her answer was lost as Orne entered the hall, closed the
door.

In the privacy of his room, Orne pressed the transceiver stud at his
neck, said: _""Stet?""_

A voice hissed in his ears: _""This is Mr. Stetson's relief. Orne, isn't
it?""_

_""Yes. I want a check right away on those Nathian records the
archaeologists found. Find out if Heleb was one of the planets they
seeded.""_

_""Right. Hang on.""_ There was a long silence, then: _""Lew, this is Stet.
How come the question about Heleb?""_

_""Was it on that Nathian list?""_

_""Negative. Why'd you ask?""_

_""Are you sure, Stet? It'd explain a lot of things.""_

_""It's not on the lists, but ... wait a minute.""_ Silence. Then: _""Heleb
was on line of flight to Auriga, and Auriga was on the list. We've
reason to doubt they put anyone down on Auriga. If their ship ran into
trouble--""_

_""That's it!""_ snapped Orne.

_""Keep your voice down or talk subvocally.""_ ordered Stetson. _""Now,
answer my question: What's up?""_

_""Something so fantastic it frightens me,""_ said Orne. _""Remember that
the women who ruled Heleb bred female or male children by controlling
the sex of their offspring at conception. The method was unique. In
fact, our medics thought it was impossible until--""_

_""You don't have to remind me of something we want buried and
forgotten,""_ interrupted Stetson. _""Too much chance for misuse of that
formula.""_

_""Yes,""_ said Orne. _""But what if your Nathian underground is composed
entirely of women bred the same way? What if the Heleb women were just a
bunch who got out of hand because they'd lost contact with the main
element?""_

_""Holy Moley!""_ blurted Stetson. _""Do you have evidence--""_

_""Nothing but a hunch,""_ said Orne. _""Do you have a list of the guests
who'll be here for the election party tomorrow?""_

_""We can get it. Why?""_

_""Check for women who mastermind their husbands in politics. Let me know
how many and who.""_

_""Lew, that's not enough to--""_

_""That's all I can give you for now, but I think I'll have more.
Remember that ...""_ he hesitated, spacing his words as a new thought
struck him _""... the ... Nathians ... were ... nomads.""_
",haystack,herbert,1959,1,714
"
Day began early for the Bullones. In spite of its being election day,
Bullone took off for his office an hour after dawn. ""See what I mean
about this job owning you?"" he asked Orne.

""We're going to take it easy today, Lew,"" said Diana. She took his hand
as they came up the steps after seeing her father to his limousine
flitter. The sky was cloudless.

Orne felt himself liking her hand in his--liking the feel of it too
much. He withdrew his hand, stood aside, said: ""Lead on.""

_I've got to watch myself_, he thought. _She's too charming._

""I think a picnic,"" said Diana. ""There's a little lake with grassy banks
off to the west. We'll take viewers and a couple of good novels. This'll
be a do-nothing day.""

Orne hesitated. There might be things going on at the house that he
should watch. But no ... if he was right about this situation, then
Diana could be the weak link. Time was closing in on them, too. By
tomorrow the Nathians could have the government completely under
control.

It was warm beside the lake. There were purple and orange flowers above
the grassy bank. Small creatures flitted and cheeped in the brush and
trees. There was a _groomis_ in the reeds at the lower end of the lake,
and every now and then it honked like an old man clearing his throat.

""When we girls were all at home we used to picnic here every Eight-day,""
said Diana. She lay on her back on the groundmat they'd spread. Orne sat
beside her facing the lake. ""We made a raft over there on the other
side,"" she said. She sat up, looked across the lake. ""You know, I think
pieces of it are still there. See?"" She pointed at a jumble of logs. As
she gestured, her hand brushed Orne's.

Something like an electric shock passed between them. Without knowing
exactly how it happened, Orne found his arms around Diana, their lips
pressed together in a lingering kiss. Panic was very close to the
surface in Orne. He broke away.

""I didn't plan for that to happen,"" whispered Diana.

""Nor I,"" muttered Orne. He shook his head. ""Sometimes things can get
into an awful mess!""

Diana blinked. ""Lew ... don't you ... like me?""

He ignored the monitoring transceiver, spoke his mind. _They'll just
think it's part of the act_, he thought. And the thought was bitter.

""Like you?"" he asked. ""I think I'm in love with you!""

She sighed, leaned against his shoulder. ""Then what's wrong? You're not
already married. Mother had your service record checked."" Diana smiled
impishly. ""Mother has second sight.""

The bitterness was like a sour taste in Orne's mouth. He could see the
pattern so clearly. ""Di, I ran away from home when I was seventeen,"" he
said.

""I know, darling. Mother's told me all about you.""

""You don't understand,"" he said. ""My father died before I was born.
He--""

""It must've been very hard on your mother,"" she said. ""Left all alone
with her family ... and a new baby on the way.""

""They'd known for a long time,"" said Orne. ""My father had _Broach's_
disease, and they found out too late. It was already in the central
nervous system.""

""How horrible,"" whispered Diana.

Orne's mind felt suddenly like a fish out of water. He found himself
grasping at a thought that flopped around just out of reach. ""Dad was in
politics,"" he whispered. He felt as though he were living in a dream.
His voice stayed low, shocked. ""From when I first began to talk, Mother
started grooming me to take his place in public life.""

""And you didn't like politics,"" said Diana.

""I hated it!"" he growled. ""First chance, I ran away. One of my sisters
married a young fellow who's now the member for Chargon. I hope he
enjoys it!""

""That'd be Maddie,"" said Diana.

""You know her?"" asked Orne. Then he remembered what Stetson had told
him, and the thought was chilling.

""Of course I know her,"" said Diana. ""Lew, what's wrong with you?""

""You'd expect me to play the same game, you calling the shots,"" he said.
""Shoot for the top, cut and scramble, claw and dig.""

""By tomorrow all that may not be necessary,"" she said.

Orne heard the sudden hiss of the carrier wave in his neck transceiver,
but there was no voice from the monitor.

""What's ... happening ... tomorrow?"" he asked.

""The election, silly,"" she said. ""Lew, you're acting very strangely. Are
you sure you're feeling all right."" She put a hand to his forehead.
""Perhaps we'd--""

""Just a minute,"" said Orne. ""About us--"" He swallowed.

She withdrew her hand. ""I think my parents already suspect. We Bullones
are notorious love-at-first-sighters."" Her overlarge eyes studied him
fondly. ""You don't feel feverish, but maybe we'd better--""

""What a dope I am!"" snarled Orne. ""I just realized that I have to be a
Nathian, too.""

""You _just_ realized?"" She stared at him.

There was a hissing gasp in Orne's transceiver.

""The identical patterns in our families,"" he said. ""Even to the houses.
And there's the real key. What a dope!"" He snapped his fingers. ""_The
head!_ Polly! Your mother's the grand boss woman, isn't she?""

""But, darling ... of course. She--""

""You'd better take me to her and fast!"" snapped Orne. He touched the
stud at his neck, but Stetson's voice intruded.

_""Great work, Lew! We're moving in a special shock force. Can't take any
chances with--""_

Orne spoke aloud in panic: _""Stet! You get out to the Bullones! And you
get there alone! No troops!""_

Diana had jumped to her feet, backed away from him.

_""What do you mean?""_ demanded Stetson.

_""I'm saving our stupid necks!""_ barked Orne. _""Alone! You hear? Or
we'll have a worse mess on our hands than any Rim War!""_

There was an extended silence. _""You hear me, Stet?""_ demanded Orne.

_""O.K., Lew. We're putting the O-force on standby. I'll be at the
Bullones' in ten minutes. ComGO will be with me.""_ Pause. _""And you'd
better know what you're doing!""_

It was an angry group in a corner of the Bullones' main salon. Louvered
shades cut the green glare of a noon sun. In the background there was
the hum of air-conditioning and the clatter of roboservants preparing
for the night's election party. Stetson leaned against the wall beside a
divan, hands jammed deeply into the pockets of his wrinkled, patched
fatigues. The wagon tracks furrowed his high forehead. Near Stetson,
Admiral Sobat Spencer, the I-A's Commander of Galactic Operations, paced
the floor. ComGO was a bull-necked bald man with wide blue eyes, a
deceptively mild voice. There was a caged animal look to his
pacing--three steps out, three steps back.
",haystack,herbert,1959,1,1131
"
On his last night on Earth, Ted Graham stepped out of a glass-walled
telephone booth, ducked to avoid a swooping moth that battered itself in
a frenzy against a bare globe above the booth.

Ted Graham was a long-necked man with a head of pronounced egg shape
topped by prematurely balding sandy hair. Something about his lanky,
intense appearance suggested his occupation: certified public
accountant.

He stopped behind his wife, who was studying a newspaper classified
page, and frowned. ""They said to wait here. They'll come get us. Said
the place is hard to find at night.""

Martha Graham looked up from the newspaper. She was a doll-faced woman,
heavily pregnant, a kind of pink prettiness about her. The yellow glow
from the light above the booth subdued the red-auburn cast of her
ponytail hair.

""I just _have_ to be in a house when the baby's born,"" she said. ""What'd
they sound like?""

""I dunno. There was a funny kind of interruption--like an argument in
some foreign language.""

""Did they sound foreign?""

""In a way."" He motioned along the night-shrouded line of trailers toward
one with two windows glowing amber. ""Let's wait inside. These bugs out
here are fierce.""

""Did you tell them which trailer is ours?""

""Yes. They didn't sound at all anxious to look at it. That's odd--them
wanting to trade their house for a trailer.""

""There's nothing odd about it. They've probably just got itchy feet like
we did.""

He appeared not to hear her. ""Funniest-sounding language you ever heard
when that argument started--like a squirt of noise.""

Inside the trailer, Ted Graham sat down on the green couch that opened
into a double bed for company.

""They could use a good tax accountant around here,"" he said. ""When I
first saw the place, I got that definite feeling. The valley looks
prosperous. It's a wonder nobody's opened an office here before.""

His wife took a straight chair by the counter separating kitchen and
living area, folded her hands across her heavy stomach.

""I'm just continental tired of wheels going around under me,"" she said.
""I want to sit and stare at the same view for the rest of my life. I
don't know how a trailer ever seemed glamorous when--""

""It was the inheritance gave us itchy feet,"" he said.

Tires gritted on gravel outside.

Martha Graham straightened. ""Could that be them?""

""Awful quick, if it is."" He went to the door, opened it, stared down at
the man who was just raising a hand to knock.

""Are you Mr. Graham?"" asked the man.

""Yes."" He found himself staring at the caller.

""I'm Clint Rush. You called about the house?"" The man moved farther into
the light. At first, he'd appeared an old man, fine wrinkle lines in his
face, a tired leather look to his skin. But as he moved his head in the
light, the wrinkles seemed to dissolve--and with them, the years lifted
from him.

""Yes, we called,"" said Ted Graham. He stood aside. ""Do you want to look
at the trailer now?""

Martha Graham crossed to stand beside her husband. ""We've kept it in
awfully good shape,"" she said. ""We've never let anything get seriously
wrong with it.""

_She sounds too anxious_, thought Ted Graham. _I wish she'd let me do
the talking for the two of us._

""We can come back and look at your trailer tomorrow in daylight,"" said
Rush. ""My car's right out here, if you'd like to see our house.""

Ted Graham hesitated. He felt a nagging worry tug at his mind, tried to
fix his attention on what bothered him.

""Hadn't we better take our car?"" he asked. ""We could follow you.""

""No need,"" said Rush. ""We're coming back into town tonight anyway. We
can drop you off then.""

Ted Graham nodded. ""Be right with you as soon as I lock up.""

Inside the car, Rush mumbled introductions. His wife was a dark shadow
in the front seat, her hair drawn back in a severe bun. Her features
suggested gypsy blood. He called her Raimee.

_Odd name_, thought Ted Graham. And he noticed that she, too, gave that
strange first impression of age that melted in a shift of light.

Mrs. Rush turned her gypsy features toward Martha Graham. ""You are going
to have a baby?""

It came out as an odd, veiled statement.

Abruptly, the car rolled forward.

Martha Graham said, ""It's supposed to be born in about two months. We
hope it's a boy.""

Mrs. Rush looked at her husband. ""I have changed my mind,"" she said.

Rush spoke without taking his attention from the road. ""It is too ...""
He broke off, spoke in a tumble of strange sounds.

Ted Graham recognized it as the language he'd heard on the telephone.

Mrs. Rush answered in the same tongue, anger showing in the intensity of
her voice. Her husband replied, his voice calmer.

Presently, Mrs. Rush fell moodily silent.

Rush tipped his head toward the rear of the car. ""My wife has moments
when she does not want to get rid of the old house. It has been with her
for many years.""

Ted Graham said, ""Oh."" Then: ""Are you Spanish?""

Rush hesitated. ""No. We are Basque.""

He turned the car down a well-lighted avenue that merged into a highway.
They turned onto a side road. There followed more turns--left, right,
right.
",old_rambling_house,herbert,1958,1,897
"
Ted Graham lost track.

They hit a jolting bump that made Martha gasp.

""I hope that wasn't too rough on you,"" said Rush. ""We're almost there.""

The car swung into a lane, its lights picking out the skeleton outlines
of trees: peculiar trees--tall, gaunt, leafless. They added to Ted
Graham's feeling of uneasiness.

The lane dipped, ended at a low wall of a house--red brick with
clerestory windows beneath overhanging eaves. The effect of the wall and
a wide-beamed door they could see to the left was ultramodern.

Ted Graham helped his wife out of the car, followed the Rushes to the
door.

""I thought you told me it was an old house,"" he said.

""It was designed by one of the first modernists,"" said Rush. He fumbled
with an odd curved key. The wide door swung open onto a hallway equally
wide, carpeted by a deep pile rug. They could glimpse floor-to-ceiling
view windows at the end of the hall, city lights beyond.

Martha Graham gasped, entered the hall as though in a trance. Ted Graham
followed, heard the door close behind them.

""It's so--so--so _big_,"" exclaimed Martha Graham.

""You want to trade _this_ for our trailer?"" asked Ted Graham.

""It's too inconvenient for us,"" said Rush. ""My work is over the
mountains on the coast."" He shrugged. ""We cannot sell it.""

Ted Graham looked at him sharply. ""Isn't there any money around here?""
He had a sudden vision of a tax accountant with no customers.

""Plenty of money, but no real estate customers.""

They entered the living room. Sectional divans lined the walls. Subdued
lighting glowed from the corners. Two paintings hung on the opposite
walls--oblongs of odd lines and twists that made Ted Graham dizzy.

Warning bells clamored in his mind.

Martha Graham crossed to the windows, looked at the lights far away
below. ""I had no idea we'd climbed that far,"" she said. ""It's like a
fairy city.""

Mrs. Rush emitted a short, nervous laugh.

Ted Graham glanced around the room, thought: _If the rest of the house
is like this, it's worth fifty or sixty thousand_. He thought of the
trailer: _A good one, but not worth more than seven thousand_.

Uneasiness was like a neon sign flashing in his mind. ""This seems
so ..."" He shook his head.

""Would you like to see the rest of the house?"" asked Rush.

Martha Graham turned from the window. ""Oh, yes.""

Ted Graham shrugged. _No harm in looking_, he thought.

When they returned to the living room, Ted Graham had doubled his
previous estimate on the house's value. His brain reeled with the
summing of it: a solarium with an entire ceiling covered by sun lamps,
an automatic laundry where you dropped soiled clothing down a chute,
took it washed and ironed from the other end ...

""Perhaps you and your wife would like to discuss it in private,"" said
Rush. ""We will leave you for a moment.""

And they were gone before Ted Graham could protest.

Martha Graham said, ""Ted, I honestly never in my life dreamed--""

""Something's very wrong, honey.""

""But, Ted--""

""This house is worth at least a hundred thousand dollars. Maybe more.
And they want to trade _this_--"" he looked around him--""for a
seven-thousand-dollar trailer?""

""Ted, they're foreigners. And if they're so foolish they don't know the
value of this place, then why should--""

""I don't like it,"" he said. Again he looked around the room, recalled
the fantastic equipment of the house. ""But maybe you're right.""

He stared out at the city lights. They had a lacelike quality: tall
buildings linked by lines of flickering incandescence. Something like a
Roman candle shot skyward in the distance.

""Okay!"" he said. ""If they want to trade, let's go push the deal ...""

Abruptly, the house shuddered. The city lights blinked out. A humming
sound filled the air.

Martha Graham clutched her husband's arm. ""Ted! Wha-- what was that?""

""I dunno."" He turned. ""Mr. Rush!""

No answer. Only the humming.

The door at the end of the room opened. A strange man came through it.
He wore a short toga-like garment of gray, metallic cloth belted at the
waist by something that glittered and shimmered through every color of
the spectrum. An aura of coldness and power emanated from him--a sense
of untouchable hauteur.

He glanced around the room, spoke in the same tongue the Rushes had
used.

Ted Graham said, ""I don't understand you, mister.""

The man put a hand to his flickering belt. Both Ted and Martha Graham
felt themselves rooted to the floor, a tingling sensation vibrating
along every nerve.

Again the strange language rolled from the man's tongue, but now the
words were understood.
",old_rambling_house,herbert,1958,1,783
"
""Who are you?""

""My name's Graham. This is my wife. What's going--""

""How did you get here?""

""The Rushes--they wanted to trade us this house for our trailer. They
brought us. Now look, we--""

""What is your talent--your occupation?""

""Tax accountant. Say! Why all these--""

""That was to be expected,"" said the man. ""Clever! Oh, excessively
clever!"" His hand moved again to the belt. ""Now be very quiet. This may
confuse you momentarily.""

Colored lights filled both the Grahams' minds. They staggered.

""You are qualified,"" said the man. ""You will serve.""

""Where are we?"" demanded Martha Graham.

""The coordinates would not be intelligible to you,"" he said. ""I am of
the Rojac. It is sufficient for you to know that you are under Rojac
sovereignty.""

Ted Graham said, ""But--""

""You have, in a way, been kidnapped. And the Raimees have fled to your
planet--an unregistered planet.""

""I'm afraid,"" Martha Graham said shakily.

""You have nothing to fear,"" said the man. ""You are no longer on the
planet of your birth--nor even in the same galaxy."" He glanced at Ted
Graham's wrist. ""That device on your wrist--it tells your local time?""

""Yes.""

""That will help in the search. And your sun--can you describe its atomic
cycle?""

Ted Graham groped in his mind for his science memories from school, from
the Sunday supplements. ""I can recall that our galaxy is a spiral
like--""

""Most galaxies are spiral.""

""Is this some kind of a practical joke?"" asked Ted Graham.

The man smiled, a cold, superior smile. ""It is no joke. Now I will make
you a proposition.""

Ted nodded warily. ""All right, let's have the stinger.""

""The people who brought you here were tax collectors we Rojac recruited
from a subject planet. They were conditioned to make it impossible for
them to leave their job untended. Unfortunately, they were clever enough
to realize that if they brought someone else in who could do their job,
they were released from their mental bonds. Very clever.""

""But--""

""You may have their job,"" said the man. ""Normally, you would be put to
work in the lower echelons, but we believe in meting out justice
wherever possible. The Raimees undoubtedly stumbled on your planet by
accident and lured you into this position without--""

""How do you know I can do your job?""

""That moment of brilliance was an aptitude test. You passed. Well, do
you accept?""

""What about our baby?"" Martha Graham worriedly wanted to know.

""You will be allowed to keep it until it reaches the age of
decision--about the time it will take the child to reach adult
stature.""

[Illustration]

""Then what?"" insisted Martha Graham.

""The child will take its position in society--according to its ability.""

""Will we ever see our child after that?""

""Possibly.""

Ted Graham said, ""What's the joker in this?""

Again the cold, superior smile. ""You will receive conditioning similar
to that which we gave the Raimees. And we will want to examine your
memories to aid us in our search for your planet. It would be good to
find a new inhabitable place.""

""Why did they trap us like this?"" asked Martha Graham.

""It's lonely work,"" the man explained. ""Your house is actually a type of
space conveyance that travels along your collection route--and there is
much travel to the job. And then--you will not have friends, nor time
for much other than work. Our methods are necessarily severe at times.""

""_Travel?_"" Martha Graham repeated in dismay.

""Almost constantly.""

Ted Graham felt his mind whirling. And behind him, he heard his wife
sobbing.

The Raimees sat in what had been the Grahams' trailer.

""For a few moments, I feared he would not succumb to the bait,"" she
said. ""I knew you could never overcome the mental compulsion enough to
leave them there without their first agreeing.""

Raimee chuckled. ""Yes. And now I'm going to indulge in everything the
Rojac never permitted. I'm going to write ballads and poems.""

""And I'm going to paint,"" she said. ""Oh, the delicious freedom!""

""Greed won this for us,"" he said. ""The long study of the Grahams paid
off. They couldn't refuse to trade.""

""I knew they'd agree. The looks in their eyes when they saw the house!
They both had ..."" She broke off, a look of horror coming into her eyes.
""One of them did not agree!""

""They both did. You heard them.""

""The baby?""

He stared at his wife. ""But--but it is not at the age of decision!""

""In perhaps eighteen of this planet's years, it _will_ be at the age of
decision. What then?""

His shoulders sagged. He shuddered. ""I will not be able to fight it off.
I will have to build a transmitter, call the Rojac and confess!""

""And they will collect another inhabitable place,"" she said, her voice
flat and toneless.

""I've spoiled it,"" he said. ""I've spoiled it!""

DECAY.

Ross stood on the traders’ ramp, overlooking the Yards, and the word
kept bobbing to the top of his mind.

Decay.

About all of Halsey’s Planet there was the imperceptible reek of decay.
The clean, big, bustling, efficient spaceport only made the sensation
stronger. From where he stood on the height of the Ramp, he could see
the Yards, the spires of Halsey City ten kilometers away—and the
tumble-down gray acres of Ghost Town between.

Ross wrinkled his nose. He wasn’t a man given to brooding, but the scent
of decay had saturated his nostrils that morning. He had tossed and
turned all the night, wrestling with a decision. And he had got up
early, so early that the only thing that made sense was to walk to work.

And that meant walking through Ghost Town. He hadn’t done that in a long
time, not since childhood. Ghost Town was a wonderful place to play.
“Tag,” “Follow My Fuehrer,” “Senators and President”—all the ancient
games took on new life when you could dodge and turn among crumbling
ruins, dart down unmarked lanes, gallop through sagging shacks where you
might stir out a screeching, unexpected recluse.

But it was clear that—in the fifteen years between childhood games and a
troubled man’s walk to work—Ghost Town had grown.

Everybody knew that! Ask the right specialists, and they’d tell you how
much and how fast. An acre a year, a street a month, a block a week, the
specialists would twinkle at you, convinced that the acre, street, block
was under control, since they could measure it.

Ask the right specialists and they would tell you why it was happening.
One answer per specialist, with an ironclad guarantee that there would
be no overlapping of replies. “A purely psychological phenomenon, Mr.
Ross. A vibration of the pendulum toward greater municipal compactness,
a huddling, a mature recognition of the facts of interdependence,
basically a step forward....”

“A purely biological phenomenon, Mr. Ross. Falling birth rate due to
biochemical deficiency of trace elements processed out of our planetary
diet. Fortunately the situation has been recognized in time and my bill
before the Chamber will provide....”

“A purely technological problem, Mr. Ross. Maintenance of a sprawling
city is inevitably less efficient than that of a compact unit.
Inevitably there has been a drift back to the central areas and the
convenience of air-conditioned walkways, winterized plazas....”

Yes. It was a purely psychological-biological-technological-
educational-demographic problem, and it was basically a step forward.

Ross wondered how many Ghost Towns lay corpselike on the surface of
Halsey’s Planet. Decay, he thought. Decay.

But it had nothing to do with his problem, the problem that had kept him
awake all the night, the problem that blighted the view before him now.

The trading bell clanged. The day’s work began.

For Ross it might be his last day’s work at the Yards.

He walked slowly from the ramp to the offices of the Oldham Trading
Corporation. “Morning, Ross boy,” his breezy young boss greeted him.
Charles Oldham IV’s father had always taken a paternal attitude toward
his help, and Charles Oldham IV was not going to change anything that
Daddy had done. He shook Ross’s hand at the door of the suite and
apologized because they hadn’t been able to find a new secretary for him
yet. They’d been looking for two weeks, but the three applicants they
had been able to dredge up had all been hopeless. “It’s the damn
Chamber,” said Charles Oldham IV, winsomely gesturing with his hands to
show how helpless men of affairs were against the blundering
interference of Government. “Damn labor shortage is nothing but a damn
artificial scarcity crisis. Daddy saw it; he knew it was coming.”

Ross almost told him he was quitting, but held back. Maybe it was
because he didn’t want to spoil Oldham’s day with bad news, right on top
of the opening bell. Or maybe it was because, in spite of a sleepless
night, he still wasn’t quite sure.

The morning’s work helped him to become sure. It was the same monotonous
grind.

Three freighters had arrived at dawn from Halsey’s third moon, but none
of them was any affair of his. There was an export shipment of jewelry
and watches to be attended to, but the ship was not to take off for
another week. It scarcely classified as urgent. Ross worked on the
manifests for a couple of hours, stared through his window for an hour,
and then it was time for lunch.

Little Marconi hailed him as he passed through the traders’ lounge.

Of all the juniors on the Exchange, Marconi was the one Ross found
easiest to take. He was lean and dark where Ross was solid and fair;
worse, he stood four ranks above Ross in seniority. But, since Ross
worked for Oldham, and Marconi worked for Haarland’s, the difference
could be waived in social intercourse.

Ross suspected that, to Marconi as to him, trading was only a job—a dull
one, and not a crusade. And he knew that Marconi’s reading was not
confined to bills of lading. “Lunch?” asked Marconi. “Sure,” Ross said.
And he knew he’d probably spill his secret to the little man from
Haarland’s.

The skyroom was crowded—comparatively. All eight of the usual tables
were taken; they pushed on into the roped-off area by the windows and
found a table overlooking the Yards. Marconi blew dust off his chair.
“Been a long time since this was used,” he grumbled. “Drink?” He raised
his eyebrows when Ross nodded. It made a break; Marconi was the one
usually who had a drink with lunch, Ross never touched it.

When the drinks came, each of them said to the other in perfect
synchronism: “I’ve got something to tell you.”

They looked startled—then laughed. “Go ahead,” said Ross.

The little man didn’t even argue. Rapturously he drew a photo out of his
pocket.

God, thought Ross wearily, Lurline again! He studied the picture with a
show of interest. “New snap?” he asked brightly. “Lovely girl——” Then he
noticed the inscription: _To my fiance, with crates of love._ “Well!” he
said, “Fiance, is it? Congratulations, Marconi!”
",skysearch,pohl,1954,1,1032
"
Marconi was almost drooling on the photo. “Next month,” he said happily.
“A big, big wedding. For keeps, Ross—for keeps. With children!”

Ross made an expression of polite surprise. “You don’t say!” he said.

“It’s all down in black and white! She agrees to have two children in
the first five years—no permissive clause, a straight guarantee. Fifteen
hundred annual allowance per child. And, Ross, do you know what? Her
lawyer told her right in front of me that she ought to ask for three
thousand, and she told him, ‘No, Mr. Turek. I happen to be in love.’ How
do you like that, Ross?”

“A girl in a million,” Ross said feebly. His private thoughts were that
Marconi had been gaffed and netted like a sugar perch. Lurline was of
the Old Landowners, who didn’t own anything much but land these days,
and Marconi was an undersized nobody who happened to make a very good
living. Sure she happened to be in love. Smartest thing she could be. Of
course, promising to have children sounded pretty special; but the
papers were full of those things every day. Marconi could reliably be
counted on to hang himself. He’d promise her breakfast in bed every
third week end, or the maid that he couldn’t possibly find on the labor
market, and the courts would throw all the promises on both sides out of
the contract as a matter of simple equity. But the marriage would stick,
all right.

Marconi had himself a final moist, fatuous sigh and returned the photo
to his pocket. “And now,” he asked brightly, craning his neck for the
waiter, “what’s your news?”

Ross sipped his drink, staring out at the nuzzling freighters in their
hemispherical slips. He said abruptly, “I might be on one of those next
week. Fallon’s got a purser’s berth open.”

Marconi forgot the waiter and gaped. “Quitting?”

“I’ve got to do something!” Ross exploded. His own voice scared him;
there was a knife blade of hysteria in the sound of it. He gripped the
edge of the table and forced himself to be calm and deliberate.

Marconi said tardily, “Easy, Ross.”

“Easy! You’ve said it, Marconi: ‘Easy.’ Everything’s so damned easy and
so damned boring that I’m just about ready to blow! I’ve got to do
something,” he repeated. “I’m getting nowhere! I push papers around and
then I push them back again. You know what happens next. You get soft
and paunchy. You find yourself going by the book instead of by your
head. You’re covered, if you go by the book—no matter what happens. And
you might just as well be dead!”

“Now, Ross——”

“Now, hell!” Ross flared. “Marconi, I swear I think there’s something
wrong with me! Look, take Ghost Town for instance. Ever wonder why
nobody lives there, except a couple of crazy old hermits?”

“Why, it’s Ghost Town,” Marconi explained. “It’s deserted.”

“And why is it deserted? What happened to the people who used to live
there?”

Marconi shook his head. “You need a vacation, son,” he said
sympathetically. “That was a long time ago. Hundreds of years, maybe.”

“But where did the people go?” Ross persisted desperately. “All of the
city was inhabited hundreds of years ago—the city was twice as big as it
is now. How come?”

Marconi shrugged. “Dunno.”

Ross collapsed. “Don’t know. You don’t know, I don’t know, nobody knows.
Only thing is, I care! I’m curious. Marconi, I get—well, moody.
Depressed. I get to worrying about crazy things. Ghost Town, for one.
And why can’t they find a secretary for me? And am I really different
from everybody else or do I just think so—and doesn’t that mean that I’m
insane?”

He laughed. Marconi said warmly, “Ross, you aren’t the only one; don’t
ever think you are. I went through it myself. Found the answer, too. You
wait, Ross.”

He paused. Ross said suspiciously, “Yeah?”

Marconi tapped the breast pocket with the photo of Lurline. “She’ll come
along,” he said.

Ross managed not to sneer in his face. “No,” he said wearily. “Look, I
don’t advertise it, but I was married once. I was eighteen, it lasted
for a year and I’m the one who walked out. Flat-fee settlement; it took
me five years to pay off the loan, but I never regretted it.”

Marconi began gravely, “Sexual incompatibility——”

Ross cut him off with an impatient gesture. “In that department,” he
said, “it so happens she was a genius. But——”

“But?”

Ross shrugged. “I must have been crazy,” he said shortly. “I kept
thinking that she was half-dead, dying on the vine like the rest of
Halsey’s Planet. And I must still be crazy, because I still think so.”

The little man involuntarily felt his breast pocket. He said gently,
“Maybe you’ve been working too hard.”

“Too hard!” Ross laughed, a curious blend of true humor and
self-disgust. “Well,” he admitted, “I need a change, anyhow. I might as
well be on a longliner. At least I’d have my spree to look back on.”

“No!” Marconi said, so violently that Ross slopped the drink he was
lifting to his mouth.

Ross looked hard at the little man—hard and speculatively. “No, then,”
he said. “It was just a figure of speech, of course. But tell me
something, won’t you, Marconi?”
",skysearch,pohl,1954,1,887
"
“Tell you what?”

“Tell me why such a violent reaction to the word ‘longliner.’ I want to
know.”

“Hell, Ross,” the little man grumbled, “you know what a longliner is.
Gutter-scrapings for crews; nothing for a man like you.”

“I want to know more,” Ross insisted. “When I ask you what a longliner
is, what the crew do with themselves for two or three centuries, you
change the subject. You always change the subject! Maybe you know
something I don’t know. I want to know what it is, and this time the
subject doesn’t get changed. You don’t get off the hook until I find
out.” He took a sip of his drink and leaned back. “Tell me about
longliners,” he said. “I’ve never seen one coming in; it’s been fifteen
years or so since that bucket from Sirius IV, hasn’t it? But you were on
the job then.”

Marconi was no longer a man in love or one of the few people whom Ross
considered to be wholly alive—like him. He was a hard-eyed little
stranger with a stubborn mouth and an ingratiating veneer. In short he
was again a trader, and a good one.

“I’ll tell you anything I know,” Marconi declared positively, and
insincerely. “Tend to that fellow first though, will you?” He pointed to
a uniformed Yards messenger whose eye had just alighted on Ross. The man
threaded his way, stumbling, through the tables and laid a sealed
envelope down in the puddle left by Ross’s drink.

“Sorry, sir,” he said crisply, wiped off the envelope with his
handkerchief and, for lagniappe, wiped the puddle off the table into
Ross’s lap.

Speechless, Ross signed for the envelope on a red-tabbed slip marked
URGENT * PRIORITY * RUSH. The messenger saluted, almost putting his own
eye out, and left, crashing into tables and chairs.

“Half-dead,” Ross muttered, following him with his eyes. “How the devil
do they stay alive at all?”

Marconi said, unsmiling, “You’re taking this kick pretty seriously,
Ross. I admit he’s a little clumsy, but——”

“But nothing,” said Ross. “Don’t try to tell me you don’t know
something’s wrong, Marconi! He’s a bumbling incompetent, and half his
generation is just like him.” He looked bitterly at the envelope and
dropped it on the table again. “More manifests,” he said. “I swear I’ll
start throwing tableware if I have to check another bill of lading.
Brighten my day, Marconi; tell me about the longliners. You’re not off
the hook yet, you know.”

Marconi signaled for another drink. “All right,” he said. “Marconi tells
all about longliners. They’re ships. They go from the planet of one star
to the planet of another star. It takes a long time, because stars are
many light-years apart and rocket ships cannot travel as fast as light.
Einstein said so—whoever he was. Do we start with the Sirius IV ship? I
was around when it came in, all right. Fifteen years ago, and Halsey’s
Planet is still enjoying the benefits of it. And so is Leverett and Sons
Trading Corporation. They did fine on flowers from seeds that bucket
brought, they did fine on sugar perch from eggs that bucket brought.
I’ve never had it myself. Raw fish for dessert! But some people swear by
it—at five shields a portion. They can have it.”

“The hook, Marconi,” Ross reminded grimly.

Trader Marconi laughed amiably. “Sorry. Well, what else? Pictures and
music, but I’m not much on them. I do read, though, and as a reader I
say, God bless that bucket from Sirius IV. We never had a novelist like
Morris Halliday on this planet—or an essayist like Jay Waring. Let’s
see, there have been eight Halliday novels off the microfilms so far,
and I think Leverett still has a couple in the vaults. Leverett must
be——”

“Marconi. I don’t want to hear about Leverett and Sons. Or Morris
Halliday, or Waring. I want to hear about longliners.”

“I’m trying to tell you,” Marconi said sullenly, the mask down.

“No, you’re not. You’re telling me that the longline ships go from one
stellar system to another with merchandise. I know that.”

“Then what do you want?”

“Don’t be difficult, Marconi. I want to know the facts. All about
longliners. The big hush-hush. The candid explanations that explain
nothing—except that a starship is a starship. I know that they’re
closed-system, multigeneration jobs; a group of people get in on Sirius
IV and their great-great-great-great-grandchildren come giggling and
stumbling out on Halsey’s Planet. I know that every couple of
generations your firm—and mine, for that matter—builds one with profits
that would be taxed off anyway and slings it out, stocked with seeds and
film and sound tape and patent designs and manufacturing specifications
for every new gimmick on the market, in the hope that it’ll be back long
after we’re dead with a similar cargo to enrich your firm’s and my
firm’s then-current owners. Sounds silly—but, as I say, it’s tax money
anyhow. I know that your firm and mine staff the ships with half a dozen
bums of each sex, who are loaded aboard with a dandy case of delirium
tremens, contracted from spending their bounty money the only way they
know how. And that’s just about all I know. Take it from there, Marconi.
And be specific.”
",skysearch,pohl,1954,1,887
"
The little man shrugged irritably. “That gag’s beginning to wear thin,
Ross,” he complained. “What do you want me to tell you—the number of
welds in Bulkhead 47 of ‘Starship 74’? What’s the difference? As you
said, a starship is a starship is a longliner. Without them the
inhabited solar systems would have no means of contact or commerce. What
else is there to say?”

Ross looked suddenly lost. “I—don’t know,” he said. “Don’t you know,
Marconi?”

Marconi hesitated, and for a moment Ross was sure he did know—knew
something, at any rate, something that might be an answer to the doubts
and nagging inconsistencies that were bothering him. But then Marconi
shrugged and looked at his watch and ordered another drink.

But there was something wrong. Ross felt himself in the position of a
diagnostician whose patient willfully refuses to tell where it hurts.
The planet was sick—but wouldn’t admit it. Sick? Dying! Maybe he was on
the wrong track entirely. Maybe the starships had nothing to do with it.
Maybe there was nothing that Marconi knew that would fit a piece into
the puzzle and make the answer come out all clear—but Ghost Town
continued to grow acre by acre, year by year. And Oldham still hadn’t
found him a secretary capable of writing her own name.

“According to the historians, everything fits nicely into place,” Ross
said, dubiously. “They say we came here ourselves in longliners once,
Marconi. Our ancestors under some man named Halsey colonized this place,
fourteen hundred years ago. According to the longliners that come in
from other stars, their ancestors colonized wherever they came from in
starships from a place called Earth. Where is this Earth, Marconi?”

Marconi said succinctly, “Look in the star charts. It’s there.”

“Yes, but——”

“But, hell,” Marconi said in annoyance. “What in the world has got into
you, Ross? Earth is a planet like any other planet. The starship Halsey
colonized in was a starship like any other starship—only bigger. I
guess, that is—I wasn’t there. After all, what are the longliners but
colonists? They happen to be going to planets that are already
inhabited, that’s all. So a starship is nothing new or even very
interesting, and this is beginning to bore me, and you ought to read
your urgent-priority-rush message.”

Ross felt repentant—knowing that that was just how Trader Marconi wanted
him to feel. He said slowly, “I’m sorry if I’m being a nuisance,
Marconi. You know how it is when you feel stale and restless. I know all
the stories—but it’s so damned hard to believe them. The famous
colonizing ships. They must have been absolutely gigantic to take any
reasonable number of people on a closed-circuit, multigeneration ride.
We can’t build them that big now!”

“No reason to.”

“But we couldn’t if we had to. Imagine shooting those things all over
the Galaxy. How many inhabited planets in the charts—five hundred? A
thousand? Think of the technology, Marconi. What became of it?”

“We don’t need that sort of technology any more,” Marconi explained.
“That job is done. Now we concentrate on more important things. Learning
to live with each other. Developing our own planet. Increasing our
understanding of social factors and demographic——”

Ross was laughing at last. “Well, Marconi,” he said at last, “that takes
care of that! We sure have figured out how to handle the social factors,
all right. Every year there are fewer of them to handle. Pretty soon
we’ll all be dead, and then the problem can be marked ‘solved.’”

Marconi laughed too—eagerly, as if he’d been waiting for the chance. He
said, “Now that that’s settled, are you going to open your message? Are
you at least going to have some lunch?”
",skysearch,pohl,1954,1,623
"
The Yards messenger stumbled up to their table again, this time with an
envelope for Marconi. He looked sharply at Ross’s unopened envelope and
said nothing, pointedly. Ross guiltily picked it up and tore it open.
You could act like a sulky child in front of a friend, but strangers
didn’t understand.

The message was from his office. RADAR REPORTS HIGH VELOCITY SPACECRAFT
ON AUTOCONTROLS. FIRST APPROXIMATION TRAJECTORY INDICATES INTERSTELLAR
ORIGIN. PROBABLE ETA YARDS 1500. NO RADIO MESSAGES RECEIVED. DON’T HAVE
TO TELL YOU TO GET ON THIS IMMEDIATELY AND GIVE IT YOUR BEST. OLDHAM.

Ross looked at Marconi, whose expression was perturbed. “Bet I know what
your message says,” he offered with an uneasy quaver in his voice.

Marconi said: “I’ll bet you do. Oldham’s radar setup on Sunward always
has been better than Haarland’s. Better location. Man, you are in
trouble! Let’s get out there and hope nobody’s missed you so far.”

They grabbed sandwiches from the snack bar on the way out and munched
them while the Yards jeep took them to the ready line. Skirting the
freighters in their pits, slipping past the enormous overhaul sheds,
they saw excited debates going on. Twice they were passed by Yards
vehicles heading toward the landing area. Halfway to the line they heard
the recall sirens warning everybody and everything out of the ten seared
acres surrounded by homing and Ground-Controlled Approach radars. That
was where the big ones were landed.

The ready line was jammed when they got there. Ships from one or another
of the five moons that circled Halsey’s planet were common; the moons
were the mines. Even the weekly liner and freighters from the colony on
Sunward, the planet next in from Halsey’s, were routine to the Yards
workers. But to anybody an interstellar ship was a sensation, a
once-or-twice-in-a-lifetime thrill.

Protocols were uncertain. Traders argued about the first crack at the
strangers and their goods. A dealer named Aalborg said the only fair
system would be to give every trade there an equal opportunity to do
business—in alphabetical order. Everybody agreed that under no
circumstances should the man from Leverett and Sons be allowed to
trade—everybody, except the man from Leverett and Sons. He pointed out
that his firm was the logical choice because it had more and fresher
experience in handling interstellar goods than any other....

They almost mobbed him.

It wasn’t merely money that filled the atmosphere with electric tingles.
The glamor of time-travel was on them. The crew aboard that ship were
travelers of time as well as space. The crew that had launched the ship
was dust. The crew that served it now had never seen a planet.

There was even some humility in the crowd. There were thoughtful ones
among them who reflected that it was not, after all, a very great feat
to hitch a rocket to a shell and lob it across a few million miles to a
neighboring planet. It was eclipsed by the tremendous deed whose climax
they were about to witness. The thoughtful ones shrugged and sighed as
they thought that even the starship booming down toward Halsey’s
Planet—fitted with the cleverest air replenishers and the most
miraculously efficient waste converters—was only a counter in the game
whose great rule was the mass-energy formulation of the legendary
Einstein: that there is no way to push a material object past the speed
of light.

A report swept the field that left men reeling in its wake. Radar Track
confirmed that the ship was of unfamiliar pattern. All hope that it
might be a starship launched from this very spot on the last leg of a
stupefying round trip was officially dead. The starship was foreign.

“Wonder what they have?” Marconi muttered.

“Trader!” Ross sneered ponderously. He was feeling better; the weight of
depression had been lifted for the time being, either by his confession
or the electric atmosphere. If every day were like this, he thought
vaguely....
",skysearch,pohl,1954,1,662
"
On the morning of June 15th, Guy Burckhardt woke up screaming out of a
dream.

It was more real than any dream he had ever had in his life. He could
still hear and feel the sharp, ripping-metal explosion, the violent
heave that had tossed him furiously out of bed, the searing wave of
heat.

He sat up convulsively and stared, not believing what he saw, at the
quiet room and the bright sunlight coming in the window.

He croaked, ""Mary?""

His wife was not in the bed next to him. The covers were tumbled and
awry, as though she had just left it, and the memory of the dream was
so strong that instinctively he found himself searching the floor to
see if the dream explosion had thrown her down.

[Illustration]

But she wasn't there. Of course she wasn't, he told himself, looking
at the familiar vanity and slipper chair, the uncracked window, the
unbuckled wall. It had only been a dream.

""Guy?"" His wife was calling him querulously from the foot of the
stairs. ""Guy, dear, are you all right?""

He called weakly, ""Sure.""

There was a pause. Then Mary said doubtfully, ""Breakfast is ready. Are
you sure you're all right? I thought I heard you yelling--""

Burckhardt said more confidently, ""I had a bad dream, honey. Be right
down.""

In the shower, punching the lukewarm-and-cologne he favored, he told
himself that it had been a beaut of a dream. Still, bad dreams weren't
unusual, especially bad dreams about explosions. In the past thirty
years of H-bomb jitters, who had not dreamed of explosions?

Even Mary had dreamed of them, it turned out, for he started to tell
her about the dream, but she cut him off. ""You _did_?"" Her voice was
astonished. ""Why, dear, I dreamed the same thing! Well, almost the
same thing. I didn't actually _hear_ anything. I dreamed that
something woke me up, and then there was a sort of quick bang, and
then something hit me on the head. And that was all. Was yours like
that?""

Burckhardt coughed. ""Well, no,"" he said. Mary was not one of these
strong-as-a-man, brave-as-a-tiger women. It was not necessary, he
thought, to tell her all the little details of the dream that made it
seem so real. No need to mention the splintered ribs, and the salt
bubble in his throat, and the agonized knowledge that this was death.
He said, ""Maybe there really was some kind of explosion downtown.
Maybe we heard it and it started us dreaming.""

Mary reached over and patted his hand absently. ""Maybe,"" she agreed.
""It's almost half-past eight, dear. Shouldn't you hurry? You don't
want to be late to the office.""

He gulped his food, kissed her and rushed out--not so much to be on
time as to see if his guess had been right.

But downtown Tylerton looked as it always had. Coming in on the bus,
Burckhardt watched critically out the window, seeking evidence of an
explosion. There wasn't any. If anything, Tylerton looked better than
it ever had before: It was a beautiful crisp day, the sky was
cloudless, the buildings were clean and inviting. They had, he
observed, steam-blasted the Power & Light Building, the town's only
skyscraper--that was the penalty of having Contro Chemical's main
plant on the outskirts of town; the fumes from the cascade stills left
their mark on stone buildings.

None of the usual crowd were on the bus, so there wasn't anyone
Burckhardt could ask about the explosion. And by the time he got out
at the corner of Fifth and Lehigh and the bus rolled away with a muted
diesel moan, he had pretty well convinced himself that it was all
imagination.

He stopped at the cigar stand in the lobby of his office building, but
Ralph wasn't behind the counter. The man who sold him his pack of
cigarettes was a stranger.

""Where's Mr. Stebbins?"" Burckhardt asked.

The man said politely, ""Sick, sir. He'll be in tomorrow. A pack of
Marlins today?""

""Chesterfields,"" Burckhardt corrected.

""Certainly, sir,"" the man said. But what he took from the rack and
slid across the counter was an unfamiliar green-and-yellow pack.

""Do try these, sir,"" he suggested. ""They contain an anti-cough factor.
Ever notice how ordinary cigarettes make you choke every once in a
while?""

Burckhardt said suspiciously, ""I never heard of this brand.""

""Of course not. They're something new."" Burckhardt hesitated, and the
man said persuasively, ""Look, try them out at my risk. If you don't
like them, bring back the empty pack and I'll refund your money. Fair
enough?""

Burckhardt shrugged. ""How can I lose? But give me a pack of
Chesterfields, too, will you?""

He opened the pack and lit one while he waited for the elevator. They
weren't bad, he decided, though he was suspicious of cigarettes that
had the tobacco chemically treated in any way. But he didn't think
much of Ralph's stand-in; it would raise hell with the trade at the
cigar stand if the man tried to give every customer the same
high-pressure sales talk.

The elevator door opened with a low-pitched sound of music. Burckhardt
and two or three others got in and he nodded to them as the door
closed. The thread of music switched off and the speaker in the
ceiling of the cab began its usual commercials.

No, not the _usual_ commercials, Burckhardt realized. He had been
exposed to the captive-audience commercials so long that they hardly
registered on the outer ear any more, but what was coming from the
recorded program in the basement of the building caught his
attention. It wasn't merely that the brands were mostly unfamiliar; it
was a difference in pattern.

There were jingles with an insistent, bouncy rhythm, about soft drinks
he had never tasted. There was a rapid patter dialogue between what
sounded like two ten-year-old boys about a candy bar, followed by an
authoritative bass rumble: ""Go right out and get a DELICIOUS
Choco-Bite and eat your TANGY Choco-Bite _all up_. That's
_Choco-Bite_!"" There was a sobbing female whine: ""I _wish_ I had a
Feckle Freezer! I'd do _anything_ for a Feckle Freezer!"" Burckhardt
reached his floor and left the elevator in the middle of the last one.
It left him a little uneasy. The commercials were not for familiar
brands; there was no feeling of use and custom to them.

"
But the office was happily normal--except that Mr. Barth wasn't in.
Miss Mitkin, yawning at the reception desk, didn't know exactly why.
""His home phoned, that's all. He'll be in tomorrow.""

""Maybe he went to the plant. It's right near his house.""

She looked indifferent. ""Yeah.""

A thought struck Burckhardt. ""But today is June 15th! It's quarterly
tax return day--he has to sign the return!""

Miss Mitkin shrugged to indicate that that was Burckhardt's problem,
not hers. She returned to her nails.

Thoroughly exasperated, Burckhardt went to his desk. It wasn't that he
couldn't sign the tax returns as well as Barth, he thought
resentfully. It simply wasn't his job, that was all; it was a
responsibility that Barth, as office manager for Contro Chemicals'
downtown office, should have taken.

He thought briefly of calling Barth at his home or trying to reach him
at the factory, but he gave up the idea quickly enough. He didn't
really care much for the people at the factory and the less contact he
had with them, the better. He had been to the factory once, with
Barth; it had been a confusing and, in a way, a frightening
experience. Barring a handful of executives and engineers, there
wasn't a soul in the factory--that is, Burckhardt corrected himself,
remembering what Barth had told him, not a _living_ soul--just the
machines.

According to Barth, each machine was controlled by a sort of computer
which reproduced, in its electronic snarl, the actual memory and mind
of a human being. It was an unpleasant thought. Barth, laughing, had
assured him that there was no Frankenstein business of robbing
graveyards and implanting brains in machines. It was only a matter, he
said, of transferring a man's habit patterns from brain cells to
vacuum-tube cells. It didn't hurt the man and it didn't make the
machine into a monster.

But they made Burckhardt uncomfortable all the same.

He put Barth and the factory and all his other little irritations out
of his mind and tackled the tax returns. It took him until noon to
verify the figures--which Barth could have done out of his memory and
his private ledger in ten minutes, Burckhardt resentfully reminded
himself.

He sealed them in an envelope and walked out to Miss Mitkin. ""Since
Mr. Barth isn't here, we'd better go to lunch in shifts,"" he said.
""You can go first.""

""Thanks."" Miss Mitkin languidly took her bag out of the desk drawer
and began to apply makeup.

Burckhardt offered her the envelope. ""Drop this in the mail for me,
will you? Uh--wait a minute. I wonder if I ought to phone Mr. Barth to
make sure. Did his wife say whether he was able to take phone calls?""

""Didn't say."" Miss Mitkin blotted her lips carefully with a Kleenex.
""Wasn't his wife, anyway. It was his daughter who called and left the
message.""

""The kid?"" Burckhardt frowned. ""I thought she was away at school.""

""She called, that's all I know.""

Burckhardt went back to his own office and stared distastefully at the
unopened mail on his desk. He didn't like nightmares; they spoiled his
whole day. He should have stayed in bed, like Barth.

A funny thing happened on his way home. There was a disturbance at the
corner where he usually caught his bus--someone was screaming
something about a new kind of deep-freeze--so he walked an extra
block. He saw the bus coming and started to trot. But behind him,
someone was calling his name. He looked over his shoulder; a small
harried-looking man was hurrying toward him.

Burckhardt hesitated, and then recognized him. It was a casual
acquaintance named Swanson. Burckhardt sourly observed that he had
already missed the bus.

He said, ""Hello.""

Swanson's face was desperately eager. ""Burckhardt?"" he asked
inquiringly, with an odd intensity. And then he just stood there
silently, watching Burckhardt's face, with a burning eagerness that
dwindled to a faint hope and died to a regret. He was searching for
something, waiting for something, Burckhardt thought. But whatever it
was he wanted, Burckhardt didn't know how to supply it.

Burckhardt coughed and said again, ""Hello, Swanson.""

Swanson didn't even acknowledge the greeting. He merely sighed a very
deep sigh.

""Nothing doing,"" he mumbled, apparently to himself. He nodded
abstractedly to Burckhardt and turned away.

Burckhardt watched the slumped shoulders disappear in the crowd. It
was an _odd_ sort of day, he thought, and one he didn't much like.
Things weren't going right.

Riding home on the next bus, he brooded about it. It wasn't anything
terrible or disastrous; it was something out of his experience
entirely. You live your life, like any man, and you form a network of
impressions and reactions. You _expect_ things. When you open your
medicine chest, your razor is expected to be on the second shelf; when
you lock your front door, you expect to have to give it a slight extra
tug to make it latch.

It isn't the things that are right and perfect in your life that make
it familiar. It is the things that are just a little bit wrong--the
sticking latch, the light switch at the head of the stairs that needs
an extra push because the spring is old and weak, the rug that
unfailingly skids underfoot.

It wasn't just that things were wrong with the pattern of Burckhardt's
life; it was that the _wrong_ things were wrong. For instance, Barth
hadn't come into the office, yet Barth _always_ came in.
",tunnel,pohl,1955,1,917
"
Burckhardt brooded about it through dinner. He brooded about it,
despite his wife's attempt to interest him in a game of bridge with
the neighbors, all through the evening. The neighbors were people he
liked--Anne and Farley Dennerman. He had known them all their lives.
But they were odd and brooding, too, this night and he barely listened
to Dennerman's complaints about not being able to get good phone
service or his wife's comments on the disgusting variety of television
commercials they had these days.

Burckhardt was well on the way to setting an all-time record for
continuous abstraction when, around midnight, with a suddenness that
surprised him--he was strangely _aware_ of it happening--he turned
over in his bed and, quickly and completely, fell asleep.

On the morning of June 15th, Burckhardt woke up screaming.

[Illustration]

It was more real than any dream he had ever had in his life. He could
still hear the explosion, feel the blast that crushed him against a
wall. It did not seem right that he should be sitting bolt upright in
bed in an undisturbed room.

His wife came pattering up the stairs. ""Darling!"" she cried. ""What's
the matter?""

He mumbled, ""Nothing. Bad dream.""

She relaxed, hand on heart. In an angry tone, she started to say: ""You
gave me such a shock--""

But a noise from outside interrupted her. There was a wail of sirens
and a clang of bells; it was loud and shocking.

The Burckhardts stared at each other for a heartbeat, then hurried
fearfully to the window.

There were no rumbling fire engines in the street, only a small panel
truck, cruising slowly along. Flaring loudspeaker horns crowned its
top. From them issued the screaming sound of sirens, growing in
intensity, mixed with the rumble of heavy-duty engines and the sound
of bells. It was a perfect record of fire engines arriving at a
four-alarm blaze.

Burckhardt said in amazement, ""Mary, that's against the law! Do you
know what they're doing? They're playing records of a fire. What are
they up to?""

""Maybe it's a practical joke,"" his wife offered.

""Joke? Waking up the whole neighborhood at six o'clock in the
morning?"" He shook his head. ""The police will be here in ten minutes,""
he predicted. ""Wait and see.""

But the police weren't--not in ten minutes, or at all. Whoever the
pranksters in the car were, they apparently had a police permit for
their games.

The car took a position in the middle of the block and stood silent
for a few minutes. Then there was a crackle from the speaker, and a
giant voice chanted:

 ""Feckle Freezers!
  Feckle Freezers!
  Gotta have a
  Feckle Freezer!
  Feckle, Feckle, Feckle,
  Feckle, Feckle, Feckle--""

It went on and on. Every house on the block had faces staring out of
windows by then. The voice was not merely loud; it was nearly
deafening.

Burckhardt shouted to his wife, over the uproar, ""What the hell is a
Feckle Freezer?""

""Some kind of a freezer, I guess, dear,"" she shrieked back
unhelpfully.

Abruptly the noise stopped and the truck stood silent. It was still
misty morning; the Sun's rays came horizontally across the rooftops.
It was impossible to believe that, a moment ago, the silent block had
been bellowing the name of a freezer.

""A crazy advertising trick,"" Burckhardt said bitterly. He yawned and
turned away from the window. ""Might as well get dressed. I guess
that's the end of--""

The bellow caught him from behind; it was almost like a hard slap on
the ears. A harsh, sneering voice, louder than the arch-angel's
trumpet, howled:

""Have you got a freezer? _It stinks!_ If it isn't a Feckle Freezer,
_it stinks_! If it's a last year's Feckle Freezer, _it stinks_! Only
this year's Feckle Freezer is any good at all! You know who owns an
Ajax Freezer? Fairies own Ajax Freezers! You know who owns a
Triplecold Freezer? Commies own Triplecold Freezers! Every freezer but
a brand-new Feckle Freezer _stinks_!""

The voice screamed inarticulately with rage. ""I'm warning you! Get out
and buy a Feckle Freezer right away! Hurry up! Hurry for Feckle! Hurry
for Feckle! Hurry, hurry, hurry, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle,
Feckle, Feckle....""

It stopped eventually. Burckhardt licked his lips. He started to say
to his wife, ""Maybe we ought to call the police about--"" when the
speakers erupted again. It caught him off guard; it was intended to
catch him off guard. It screamed:

""Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle. Cheap
freezers ruin your food. You'll get sick and throw up. You'll get sick
and die. Buy a Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle! Ever take a piece of
meat out of the freezer you've got and see how rotten and moldy it is?
Buy a Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle. Do you want to eat
rotten, stinking food? Or do you want to wise up and buy a Feckle,
Feckle, Feckle--""

That did it. With fingers that kept stabbing the wrong holes,
Burckhardt finally managed to dial the local police station. He got a
busy signal--it was apparent that he was not the only one with the
same idea--and while he was shakingly dialing again, the noise outside
stopped.

He looked out the window. The truck was gone.

Burckhardt loosened his tie and ordered another Frosty-Flip from the
waiter. If only they wouldn't keep the Crystal Cafe so _hot_! The new
paint job--searing reds and blinding yellows--was bad enough, but
someone seemed to have the delusion that this was January instead of
June; the place was a good ten degrees warmer than outside.

He swallowed the Frosty-Flip in two gulps. It had a kind of peculiar
flavor, he thought, but not bad. It certainly cooled you off, just as
the waiter had promised. He reminded himself to pick up a carton of
them on the way home; Mary might like them. She was always interested
in something new.
",tunnel,pohl,1955,1,987
"
He stood up awkwardly as the girl came across the restaurant toward
him. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in Tylerton.
Chin-height, honey-blonde hair and a figure that--well, it was all
hers. There was no doubt in the world that the dress that clung to her
was the only thing she wore. He felt as if he were blushing as she
greeted him.

""Mr. Burckhardt."" The voice was like distant tomtoms. ""It's wonderful
of you to let me see you, after this morning.""

He cleared his throat. ""Not at all. Won't you sit down, Miss--""

""April Horn,"" she murmured, sitting down--beside him, not where he had
pointed on the other side of the table. ""Call me April, won't you?""

She was wearing some kind of perfume, Burckhardt noted with what
little of his mind was functioning at all. It didn't seem fair that
she should be using perfume as well as everything else. He came to
with a start and realized that the waiter was leaving with an order
for _filets mignon_ for two.

""Hey!"" he objected.

""Please, Mr. Burckhardt."" Her shoulder was against his, her face was
turned to him, her breath was warm, her expression was tender and
solicitous. ""This is all on the Feckle Corporation. Please let
them--it's the _least_ they can do.""

He felt her hand burrowing into his pocket.

""I put the price of the meal into your pocket,"" she whispered
conspiratorially. ""Please do that for me, won't you? I mean I'd
appreciate it if you'd pay the waiter--I'm old-fashioned about things
like that.""

She smiled meltingly, then became mock-businesslike. ""But you must
take the money,"" she insisted. ""Why, you're letting Feckle off lightly
if you do! You could sue them for every nickel they've got, disturbing
your sleep like that.""

With a dizzy feeling, as though he had just seen someone make a rabbit
disappear into a top hat, he said, ""Why, it really wasn't so bad, uh,
April. A little noisy, maybe, but--""

""Oh, Mr. Burckhardt!"" The blue eyes were wide and admiring. ""I knew
you'd understand. It's just that--well, it's such a _wonderful_
freezer that some of the outside men get carried away, so to speak. As
soon as the main office found out about what happened, they sent
representatives around to every house on the block to apologize. Your
wife told us where we could phone you--and I'm so very pleased that
you were willing to let me have lunch with you, so that I could
apologize, too. Because truly, Mr. Burckhardt, it is a _fine_ freezer.

""I shouldn't tell you this, but--"" the blue eyes were shyly
lowered--""I'd do almost anything for Feckle Freezers. It's more than a
job to me."" She looked up. She was enchanting. ""I bet you think I'm
silly, don't you?""

Burckhardt coughed. ""Well, I--""

""Oh, you don't want to be unkind!"" She shook her head. ""No, don't
pretend. You think it's silly. But really, Mr. Burckhardt, you
wouldn't think so if you knew more about the Feckle. Let me show you
this little booklet--""

Burckhardt got back from lunch a full hour late. It wasn't only the
girl who delayed him. There had been a curious interview with a little
man named Swanson, whom he barely knew, who had stopped him with
desperate urgency on the street--and then left him cold.

But it didn't matter much. Mr. Barth, for the first time since
Burckhardt had worked there, was out for the day--leaving Burckhardt
stuck with the quarterly tax returns.

What did matter, though, was that somehow he had signed a purchase
order for a twelve-cubic-foot Feckle Freezer, upright model,
self-defrosting, list price $625, with a ten per cent ""courtesy""
discount--""Because of that _horrid_ affair this morning, Mr.
Burckhardt,"" she had said.

And he wasn't sure how he could explain it to his wife.

He needn't have worried. As he walked in the front door, his wife said
almost immediately, ""I wonder if we can't afford a new freezer, dear.
There was a man here to apologize about that noise and--well, we got
to talking and--""

She had signed a purchase order, too.

It had been the damnedest day, Burckhardt thought later, on his way up
to bed. But the day wasn't done with him yet. At the head of the
stairs, the weakened spring in the electric light switch refused to
click at all. He snapped it back and forth angrily and, of course,
succeeded in jarring the tumbler out of its pins. The wires shorted
and every light in the house went out.

""Damn!"" said Guy Burckhardt.

""Fuse?"" His wife shrugged sleepily. ""Let it go till the morning,
dear.""

Burckhardt shook his head. ""You go back to bed. I'll be right along.""

It wasn't so much that he cared about fixing the fuse, but he was too
restless for sleep. He disconnected the bad switch with a screwdriver,
stumbled down into the black kitchen, found the flashlight and climbed
gingerly down the cellar stairs. He located a spare fuse, pushed an
empty trunk over to the fuse box to stand on and twisted out the old
fuse.

When the new one was in, he heard the starting click and steady drone
of the refrigerator in the kitchen overhead.

He headed back to the steps, and stopped.

Where the old trunk had been, the cellar floor gleamed oddly bright.
He inspected it in the flashlight beam. It was metal!

""Son of a gun,"" said Guy Burckhardt. He shook his head unbelievingly.
He peered closer, rubbed the edges of the metallic patch with his
thumb and acquired an annoying cut--the edges were _sharp_.

The stained cement floor of the cellar was a thin shell. He found a
hammer and cracked it off in a dozen spots--everywhere was metal.

The whole cellar was a copper box. Even the cement-brick walls were
false fronts over a metal sheath!
",tunnel,pohl,1955,1,984
"
Baffled, he attacked one of the foundation beams. That, at least, was
real wood. The glass in the cellar windows was real glass.

He sucked his bleeding thumb and tried the base of the cellar stairs.
Real wood. He chipped at the bricks under the oil burner. Real bricks.
The retaining walls, the floor--they were faked.

It was as though someone had shored up the house with a frame of metal
and then laboriously concealed the evidence.

The biggest surprise was the upside-down boat hull that blocked the
rear half of the cellar, relic of a brief home workshop period that
Burckhardt had gone through a couple of years before. From above, it
looked perfectly normal. Inside, though, where there should have been
thwarts and seats and lockers, there was a mere tangle of braces,
rough and unfinished.

""But I _built_ that!"" Burckhardt exclaimed, forgetting his thumb. He
leaned against the hull dizzily, trying to think this thing through.
For reasons beyond his comprehension, someone had taken his boat and
his cellar away, maybe his whole house, and replaced them with a
clever mock-up of the real thing.

""That's crazy,"" he said to the empty cellar. He stared around in the
light of the flash. He whispered, ""What in the name of Heaven would
anybody do that for?""

Reason refused an answer; there wasn't any reasonable answer. For long
minutes, Burckhardt contemplated the uncertain picture of his own
sanity.

He peered under the boat again, hoping to reassure himself that it was
a mistake, just his imagination. But the sloppy, unfinished bracing
was unchanged. He crawled under for a better look, feeling the rough
wood incredulously. Utterly impossible!

He switched off the flashlight and started to wriggle out. But he
didn't make it. In the moment between the command to his legs to move
and the crawling out, he felt a sudden draining weariness flooding
through him.

Consciousness went--not easily, but as though it were being taken
away, and Guy Burckhardt was asleep.


On the morning of June 16th, Guy Burckhardt woke up in a cramped
position huddled under the hull of the boat in his basement--and raced
upstairs to find it was June 15th.

The first thing he had done was to make a frantic, hasty inspection of
the boat hull, the faked cellar floor, the imitation stone. They were
all as he had remembered them--all completely unbelievable.

The kitchen was its placid, unexciting self. The electric clock was
purring soberly around the dial. Almost six o'clock, it said. His wife
would be waking at any moment.

Burckhardt flung open the front door and stared out into the quiet
street. The morning paper was tossed carelessly against the steps--and
as he retrieved it, he noticed that this was the 15th day of June.

But that was impossible. _Yesterday_ was the 15th of June. It was not
a date one would forget--it was quarterly tax-return day.

He went back into the hall and picked up the telephone; he dialed for
Weather Information, and got a well-modulated chant: ""--and cooler,
some showers. Barometric pressure thirty point zero four, rising ...
United States Weather Bureau forecast for June 15th. Warm and sunny,
with high around--""

He hung the phone up. June 15th.

""Holy heaven!"" Burckhardt said prayerfully. Things were very odd
indeed. He heard the ring of his wife's alarm and bounded up the
stairs.

Mary Burckhardt was sitting upright in bed with the terrified,
uncomprehending stare of someone just waking out of a nightmare.

""Oh!"" she gasped, as her husband came in the room. ""Darling, I just
had the most _terrible_ dream! It was like an explosion and--""

""Again?"" Burckhardt asked, not very sympathetically. ""Mary,
something's funny! I _knew_ there was something wrong all day
yesterday and--""

He went on to tell her about the copper box that was the cellar, and
the odd mock-up someone had made of his boat. Mary looked astonished,
then alarmed, then placatory and uneasy.

She said, ""Dear, are you _sure_? Because I was cleaning that old trunk
out just last week and I didn't notice anything.""

""Positive!"" said Guy Burckhardt. ""I dragged it over to the wall to
step on it to put a new fuse in after we blew the lights out and--""

""After we what?"" Mary was looking more than merely alarmed.

""After we blew the lights out. You know, when the switch at the head
of the stairs stuck. I went down to the cellar and--""

Mary sat up in bed. ""Guy, the switch didn't stick. I turned out the
lights myself last night.""

Burckhardt glared at his wife. ""Now I _know_ you didn't! Come here and
take a look!""

He stalked out to the landing and dramatically pointed to the bad
switch, the one that he had unscrewed and left hanging the night
before....

Only it wasn't. It was as it had always been. Unbelieving, Burckhardt
pressed it and the lights sprang up in both halls.


Mary, looking pale and worried, left him to go down to the kitchen and
start breakfast. Burckhardt stood staring at the switch for a long
time. His mental processes were gone beyond the point of disbelief and
shock; they simply were not functioning.

He shaved and dressed and ate his breakfast in a state of numb
introspection. Mary didn't disturb him; she was apprehensive and
soothing. She kissed him good-by as he hurried out to the bus without
another word.

Miss Mitkin, at the reception desk, greeted him with a yawn.
""Morning,"" she said drowsily. ""Mr. Barth won't be in today.""

Burckhardt started to say something, but checked himself. She would
not know that Barth hadn't been in yesterday, either, because she was
tearing a June 14th pad off her calendar to make way for the ""new""
June 15th sheet.

He staggered to his own desk and stared unseeingly at the morning's
mail. It had not even been opened yet, but he knew that the Factory
Distributors envelope contained an order for twenty thousand feet of
the new acoustic tile, and the one from Finebeck & Sons was a
complaint.

After a long while, he forced himself to open them. They were.

By lunchtime, driven by a desperate sense of urgency, Burckhardt made Miss
Mitkin take her lunch hour first--the June-fifteenth-that-was-yesterday,
_he_ had gone first. She went, looking vaguely worried about his strained
insistence, but it made no difference to Burckhardt's mood.

The phone rang and Burckhardt picked it up abstractedly. ""Contro
Chemicals Downtown, Burckhardt speaking.""

The voice said, ""This is Swanson,"" and stopped.

Burckhardt waited expectantly, but that was all. He said, ""Hello?""

Again the pause. Then Swanson asked in sad resignation, ""Still
nothing, eh?""

""Nothing what? Swanson, is there something you want? You came up to me
yesterday and went through this routine. You--""

The voice crackled: ""Burckhardt! Oh, my good heavens, _you remember_!
Stay right there--I'll be down in half an hour!""

""What's this all about?""
",tunnel,pohl,1955,1,1154
"
""Never mind,"" the little man said exultantly. ""Tell you about it when
I see you. Don't say any more over the phone--somebody may be
listening. Just wait there. Say, hold on a minute. Will you be alone
in the office?""

""Well, no. Miss Mitkin will probably--""

""Hell. Look, Burckhardt, where do you eat lunch? Is it good and
noisy?""

""Why, I suppose so. The Crystal Cafe. It's just about a block--""

""I know where it is. Meet you in half an hour!"" And the receiver
clicked.

The Crystal Cafe was no longer painted red, but the temperature was
still up. And they had added piped-in music interspersed with
commercials. The advertisements were for Frosty-Flip, Marlin
Cigarettes--""They're sanitized,"" the announcer purred--and something
called Choco-Bite candy bars that Burckhardt couldn't remember ever
having heard of before. But he heard more about them quickly enough.

While he was waiting for Swanson to show up, a girl in the cellophane
skirt of a nightclub cigarette vendor came through the restaurant with
a tray of tiny scarlet-wrapped candies.

""Choco-Bites are _tangy_,"" she was murmuring as she came close to his
table. ""Choco-Bites are _tangier_ than tangy!""

Burckhardt, intent on watching for the strange little man who had
phoned him, paid little attention. But as she scattered a handful of
the confections over the table next to his, smiling at the occupants,
he caught a glimpse of her and turned to stare.

""Why, Miss Horn!"" he said.

The girl dropped her tray of candies.

Burckhardt rose, concerned over the girl. ""Is something wrong?""

But she fled.

The manager of the restaurant was staring suspiciously at Burckhardt,
who sank back in his seat and tried to look inconspicuous. He hadn't
insulted the girl! Maybe she was just a very strictly reared young
lady, he thought--in spite of the long bare legs under the cellophane
skirt--and when he addressed her, she thought he was a masher.

Ridiculous idea. Burckhardt scowled uneasily and picked up his menu.

""Burckhardt!"" It was a shrill whisper.

Burckhardt looked up over the top of his menu, startled. In the seat
across from him, the little man named Swanson was sitting, tensely
poised.

""Burckhardt!"" the little man whispered again. ""Let's get out of here!
They're on to you now. If you want to stay alive, come on!""

There was no arguing with the man. Burckhardt gave the hovering
manager a sick, apologetic smile and followed Swanson out. The little
man seemed to know where he was going. In the street, he clutched
Burckhardt by the elbow and hurried him off down the block.

""Did you see her?"" he demanded. ""That Horn woman, in the phone booth?
She'll have them here in five minutes, believe me, so hurry it up!""


Although the street was full of people and cars, nobody was paying any
attention to Burckhardt and Swanson. The air had a nip in it--more
like October than June, Burckhardt thought, in spite of the weather
bureau. And he felt like a fool, following this mad little man down
the street, running away from some ""them"" toward--toward what? The
little man might be crazy, but he was afraid. And the fear was
infectious.

""In here!"" panted the little man.

It was another restaurant--more of a bar, really, and a sort of
second-rate place that Burckhardt had never patronized.

""Right straight through,"" Swanson whispered; and Burckhardt, like a
biddable boy, side-stepped through the mass of tables to the far end
of the restaurant.

It was ""L""-shaped, with a front on two streets at right angles to each
other. They came out on the side street, Swanson staring coldly back
at the question-looking cashier, and crossed to the opposite sidewalk.

They were under the marquee of a movie theater. Swanson's expression
began to relax.

""Lost them!"" he crowed softly. ""We're almost there.""

He stepped up to the window and bought two tickets. Burckhardt trailed
him in to the theater. It was a weekday matinee and the place was
almost empty. From the screen came sounds of gunfire and horse's
hoofs. A solitary usher, leaning against a bright brass rail, looked
briefly at them and went back to staring boredly at the picture as
Swanson led Burckhardt down a flight of carpeted marble steps.
",tunnel,pohl,1955,1,706
"
First on the scene were Larry Dermott and Tim Casey of the State Highway
Patrol. They assumed they were witnessing the crash of a new type of Air
Force plane and slipped and skidded desperately across the field to
within thirty feet of the strange craft, only to discover that the
landing had been made without accident.

Patrolman Dermott shook his head. ""They're gettin' queerer looking every
year. Get a load of it--no wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.""

They left the car and made their way toward the strange egg-shaped
vessel.

Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its holster and said, ""Sure, and I'm
beginning to wonder if it's one of ours. No insignia and--""

A circular door slid open at that point and Dameri Tass stepped out,
yawning. He spotted them, smiled and said, ""Glork.""

They gaped at him.

""Glork is right,"" Dermott swallowed.

Tim Casey closed his mouth with an effort. ""Do you mind the color of his
face?"" he blurted.

""How could I help it?""

Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance
and yawned again. ""Gorra manigan horp soratium,"" he said.

Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman Casey shot stares at each other. ""'Tis
double talk he's after givin' us,"" Casey said.

Dameri Tass frowned. ""Harama?"" he asked.

Larry Dermott pushed his cap to the back of his head. ""That doesn't
sound like any language I've even _heard_ about.""

Dameri Tass grimaced, turned and reentered his spacecraft to emerge in
half a minute with his hands full of contraption. He held a box-like
arrangement under his left arm; in his right hand were two metal caps
connected to the box by wires.

While the patrolmen watched him, he set the box on the ground, twirled
two dials and put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to
Larry Dermott; his desire was obvious.

Trained to grasp a situation and immediately respond in manner best
suited to protect the welfare of the people of New York State, Dermott
cleared his throat and said, ""Tim, take over while I report.""

""Hey!"" Casey protested, but his fellow minion had left.

""Mandaia,"" Dameri Tass told Casey, holding out the metal cap.

""Faith, an' do I look balmy?"" Casey told him. ""I wouldn't be puttin'
that dingus on my head for all the colleens in Ireland.""

""Mandaia,"" the stranger said impatiently.

""Bejasus,"" Casey snorted, ""ye can't--""

Dermott called from the car, ""Tim, the captain says to humor this guy.
We're to keep him here until the officials arrive.""

Tim Casey closed his eyes and groaned. ""Humor him, he's after sayin'.
Orders it is."" He shouted back, ""Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's in
technicolor? Begorra, he looks like a man from Mars.""

""That's what they think,"" Larry yelled, ""and the governor is on his way.
We're to do everything possible short of violence to keep this character
here. Humor him, Tim!""

""Mandaia,"" Dameri Tass snapped, pushing the cap into Casey's reluctant
hands.

Muttering his protests, Casey lifted it gingerly and placed it on his
head. Not feeling any immediate effect, he said, ""There, 'tis satisfied
ye are now, I'm supposin'.""

The alien stooped down and flicked a switch on the little box. It
hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly shrieked and sat down on the stubble
and grass of the field. ""Begorra,"" he yelped, ""I've been murthered!"" He
tore the cap from his head.

His companion came running, ""What's the matter, Tim?"" he shouted.

Dameri Tass removed the metal cap from his own head. ""Sure, an' nothin'
is after bein' the matter with him,"" he said. ""Evidently the bhoy has
niver been a-wearin' of a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt him not at
all.""

""You can talk!"" Dermott blurted, skidding to a stop.

Dameri Tass shrugged. ""Faith, an' why not? As I was after sayin', I
shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey.""

Patrolman Dermott glared at him unbelievingly. ""You learned the language
just by sticking that Rube Goldberg deal on Tim's head?""

""Sure, an' why not?""

Dermott muttered, ""And with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue
west of Dublin.""

Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly. ""I'm after resentin' that, Larry
Dermott. Sure, an' the way we talk in Ireland is--""

Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing to a bedraggled horse that had made
its way to within fifty feet of the vessel. ""Now what could that be
after bein'?""

The patrolmen followed his stare. ""It's a horse. What else?""

""A horse?""

Larry Dermott looked again, just to make sure. ""Yeah--not much of a
horse, but a horse.""

Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically. ""And jist what is a horse, if I may be
so bold as to be askin'?""

""It's an animal you ride on.""

The alien tore his gaze from the animal to look his disbelief at the
other. ""Are you after meanin' that you climb upon the crature's back and
ride him? Faith now, quit your blarney.""

He looked at the horse again, then down at his equipment. ""Begorra,"" he
muttered, ""I'll share the kerit helmet with the crature.""

""Hey, hold it,"" Dermott said anxiously. He was beginning to feel like a
character in a shaggy dog story.

Interest in the horse was ended with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.
It swooped down on the field and settled within twenty feet of the alien
craft. Almost before it had touched, the door was flung open and the
flying windmill disgorged two bestarred and efficient-looking Army
officers.
",off_course,reynolds,1954,1,914
"
Casey and Dermott snapped them a salute.

The senior general didn't take his eyes from the alien and the
spacecraft as he spoke, and they bugged quite as effectively as had
those of the patrolmen when they'd first arrived on the scene.

""I'm Major General Browning,"" he rapped. ""I want a police cordon thrown
up around this, er, vessel. No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my
permission. As soon as Army personnel arrives, we'll take over
completely.""

""Yes, sir,"" Larry Dermott said. ""I just got a report on the radio that
the governor is on his way, sir. How about him?""

The general muttered something under his breath. Then, ""When the
governor arrives, let me know; otherwise, nobody gets through!""

Dameri Tass said, ""Faith, and what goes on?""

The general's eyes bugged still further. ""_He talks!_"" he accused.

""Yes, sir,"" Dermott said. ""He had some kind of a machine. He put it over
Tim's head and seconds later he could talk.""

""Nonsense!"" the general snapped.

Further discussion was interrupted by the screaming arrival of several
motorcycle patrolmen followed by three heavily laden patrol cars.
Overhead, pursuit planes zoomed in and began darting about nervously
above the field.

""Sure, and it's quite a reception I'm after gettin',"" Dameri Tass said.
He yawned. ""But what I'm wantin' is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,
an' I've been awake for almost a _decal_.""

Dameri Tass was hurried, via helicopter, to Washington. There he
disappeared for several days, being held incommunicado while White
House, Pentagon, State Department and Congress tried to figure out just
what to do with him.

Never in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen. Thus far, no
newspapermen had been allowed within speaking distance. Administration
higher-ups were being subjected to a volcano of editorial heat but the
longer the space alien was discussed the more they viewed with alarm the
situation his arrival had precipitated. There were angles that hadn't at
first been evident.

Obviously he was from some civilization far beyond that of Earth's. That
was the rub. No matter what he said, it would shake governments,
possibly overthrow social systems, perhaps even destroy established
religious concepts.

But they couldn't keep him under wraps indefinitely.

It was the United Nations that cracked the iron curtain. Their demands
that the alien be heard before their body were too strong and had too
much public opinion behind them to be ignored. The White House yielded
and the date was set for the visitor to speak before the Assembly.

Excitement, anticipation, blanketed the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,
multi-millionaires in Switzerland, fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in the
Argentine were raised to a zenith of expectation. Panhandlers debated
the message to come with pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued it with
their passengers; miners discussed it deep beneath the surface; pilots
argued with their co-pilots thousands of feet above.

It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.

By the time the delegates from every nation, tribe, religion, class,
color, and race had gathered in New York to receive the message from the
stars, the majority of Earth had decided that Dameri Tass was the
plenipotentiary of a super-civilization which had been viewing
developments on this planet with misgivings. It was thought this other
civilization had advanced greatly beyond Earth's and that the problems
besetting us--social, economic, scientific--had been solved by the
super-civilization. Obviously, then, Dameri Tass had come, an advisor
from a benevolent and friendly people, to guide the world aright.

And nine-tenths of the population of Earth stood ready and willing to be
guided. The other tenth liked things as they were and were quite
convinced that the space envoy would upset their applecarts.

Viljalmar Andersen, Secretary-General of the U.N., was to introduce the
space emissary. ""Can you give me an idea at all of what he is like?"" he
asked nervously.

President McCord was as upset as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation. ""I
know almost as little as you do.""

Sir Alfred Oxford protested, ""But my dear chap, you've had him for
almost two weeks. Certainly in that time--""

The President snapped back, ""You probably won't believe this, but he's
been asleep until yesterday. When he first arrived he told us he hadn't
slept for a _decal_, whatever that is; so we held off our discussion
with him until morning. Well--he didn't awaken in the morning, nor the
next. Six days later, fearing something was wrong we woke him.""

""What happened?"" Sir Alfred asked.

The President showed embarrassment. ""He used some rather ripe Irish
profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.""

Viljalmar Andersen asked, ""Well, what happened yesterday?""

""We actually haven't had time to question him. Among other things,
there's been some controversy about whose jurisdiction he comes under.
The State Department claims the Army shouldn't--""

The Secretary General sighed deeply. ""Just what _did_ he do?""

""The Secret Service reports he spent the day whistling Mother Machree
and playing with his dog, cat and mouse.""

""Dog, cat and mouse? I say!"" blurted Sir Alfred.
",off_course,reynolds,1954,1,840
"
The President was defensive. ""He had to have some occupation, and he
seems to be particularly interested in our animal life. He wanted a
horse but compromised for the others. I understand he insists all three
of them come with him wherever he goes.""

""I wish we knew what he was going to say,"" Andersen worried.

""Here he comes,"" said Sir Alfred.

Surrounded by F.B.I. men, Dameri Tass was ushered to the speaker's
stand. He had a kitten in his arms; a Scotty followed him.

The alien frowned worriedly. ""Sure,"" he said, ""and what kin all this be?
Is it some ordinance I've been after breakin'?""

McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen hastened to reassure him and made him
comfortable in a chair.

Viljalmar Andersen faced the thousands in the audience and held up his
hands, but it was ten minutes before he was able to quiet the cheering,
stamping delegates from all Earth.

Finally: ""Fellow Terrans, I shall not take your time for a lengthy
introduction of the envoy from the stars. I will only say that, without
doubt, this is the most important moment in the history of the human
race. We will now hear from the first being to come to Earth from
another world.""

He turned and gestured to Dameri Tass who hadn't been paying overmuch
attention to the chairman in view of some dog and cat hostilities that
had been developing about his feet.

But now the alien's purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and
said hoarsely. ""Faith, an' what was that last you said?""

Viljalmar Andersen repeated, ""We will now hear from the first being ever
to come to Earth from another world.""

The face of the alien went a lighter blue. ""Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist
be frightenin' a body, would ye? You don't mean to tell me this planet
isn't after bein' a member of the Galactic League?""

Andersen's face was blank. ""Galactic League?""

""Cushlamachree,"" Dameri Tass moaned. ""I've gone and put me foot in it
again. I'll be after getting _kert_ for this.""

Sir Alfred was on his feet. ""I don't understand! Do you mean you aren't
an envoy from another planet?""

Dameri Tass held his head in his hands and groaned. ""An envoy, he's
sayin', and meself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the
Carthis zoo.""

He straightened and started off the speaker's stand. ""Sure, an' I must
blast off immediately.""

Things were moving fast for President McCord but already an edge of
relief was manifesting itself. Taking the initiative, he said, ""Of
course, of course, if that is your desire."" He signaled to the bodyguard
who had accompanied the alien to the assemblage.

A dull roar was beginning to emanate from the thousands gathered in the
tremendous hall, murmuring, questioning, disbelieving.

Viljalmar Andersen felt that he must say something. He extended a
detaining hand. ""Now you are here,"" he said urgently, ""even though by
mistake, before you go can't you give us some brief word? Our world is
in chaos. Many of us have lost faith. Perhaps ...""

Dameri Tass shook off the restraining hand. ""Do I look daft? Begorry, I
should have been a-knowin' something was queer. All your weapons and
your strange ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn't yet
established a planet-wide government. Sure, an' I'll go still further.
Ye probably still have wars on this benighted world. No wonder it is ye
haven't been invited to join the Galactic League an' take your place
among the civilized planets.""

He hustled from the rostrum and made his way, still surrounded by
guards, to the door by which he had entered. The dog and the cat trotted
after, undismayed by the furor about them.

They arrived about four hours later at the field on which he'd landed,
and the alien from space hurried toward his craft, still muttering. He'd
been accompanied by a general and by the President, but all the way he
had refrained from speaking.

He scurried from the car and toward the spacecraft.

President McCord said, ""You've forgotten your pets. We would be glad if
you would accept them as--""

The alien's face faded a light blue again. ""Faith, an' I'd almost
forgotten,"" he said. ""If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined
planet, my name'd be _nork_. Keep your dog and your kitty."" He shook his
head sadly and extracted a mouse from a pocket. ""An' this amazin' little
crature as well.""

They followed him to the spacecraft. Just before entering, he spotted
the bedraggled horse that had been present on his landing.

A longing expression came over his highly colored face. ""Jist one
thing,"" he said. ""Faith now, were they pullin' my leg when they said you
were after ridin' on the back of those things?""

The President looked at the woebegone nag. ""It's a horse,"" he said,
surprised. ""Man has been riding them for centuries.""

Dameri Tass shook his head. ""Sure, an' 'twould've been my makin' if I
could've taken one back to Carthis."" He entered his vessel.

The others drew back, out of range of the expected blast, and watched,
each with his own thoughts, as the first visitor from space hurriedly
left Earth.


                                                           ... THE END
",off_course,reynolds,1954,1,872
"
They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.
In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the
timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its
quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by
power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free
swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.

They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such
bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting
Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody
from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were
pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel
nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to
remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned
up at all.

In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations
before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible
in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to
his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.

The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them
back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him
through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.
But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had
plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited
crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or
three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.

He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the
Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long
haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of
space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,
boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one
room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in
autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to
find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like
Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a
mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy
beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.

No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and
made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There
wasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to
keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He
was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking
about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.

They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.

The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was
typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,
Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America
who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against
having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his
eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.

That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans
Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced
Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more
courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under
the Ultrawelfare State.

Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,
Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, ""Any more
bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to
the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have
miserably failed.""

Girard-Perregaux said easily, ""I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.
In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.""

""That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take
Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has
been trained. There aren't two men on North America--there aren't two
men in the world!--who better realize the urgency of continuing our
delving into space."" Gubelin snapped his fingers. ""Like that, either of
us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the
road to his destiny.""
",spaceman_spree,reynolds,1963,1,758
"
His friend said drily, ""Either of us could have volunteered for pilot
training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.""

""At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers
throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could
foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to
lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face
adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our
ancestors did?""

Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea
and tequila. He said, ""Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the
present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's
way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with
the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous
pastimes.""

Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap
rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. ""Face
reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more
than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our
Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb
security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our
society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,
clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level
of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted
into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the
population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude
dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was
you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out
the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six
trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable
life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the
very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.
He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years
of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he
made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was
drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now
free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to
our pleas for a few more trips?""

""But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....""

Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,
seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off
the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken
man.

He said, ""No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has
always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in
actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to
the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one
need face danger--ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the
fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.""

His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. ""Let's
leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the
point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will
take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate
pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next
explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been
increasingly hard to come by--even though in _our_ minds, Hans, we are
near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so
spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take
hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated
to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be
that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies
on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space
Exploration.""

""So...."" Girard-Perregaux said gently.

""So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!""

""Now we are getting to matters."" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.
Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his
face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. ""And do not the ends
justify the means?""

Gubelin blinked at him.

The other chuckled. ""The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have
failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read
of the sailor and his way of life?""

""Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to
do with it?""
",spaceman_spree,reynolds,1963,1,774
"
""You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more
than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,
tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never
heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his
birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at
sea--and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out
for years at a stretch before returning to home port--he would talk
of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be
one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and
heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning
would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in
jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.""

Gubelin grunted bitterly. ""Unfortunately, our present-day sailor
can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd
personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over
the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.""

He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his
universal credit card. ""The ultimate means of exchange,"" he grunted.
""Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,
nobody can, ah, _con_ you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever
our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?""

The other chuckled again. ""It is simply a matter of finding more modern
methods, my dear chap.""


Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any
excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age
of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't
been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his
name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.

When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications
were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in
the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training
for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had
taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed
the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It
had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty
take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.

Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,
a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of
dangers met and passed.

Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented
him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor
needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.

He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't
any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the
reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the
fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or
not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did
you need?

It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.

In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake
in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.
They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of
working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.
It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working
but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It
became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in
thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was
to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none
of them ever really becoming efficient.

The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain
unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of
unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a
reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year
and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees
were needed, a draft lottery was held.

All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you
were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen
might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were
granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks
they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the
dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be
sold for a lump sum on the market.

Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own
vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most
of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was
obviously called for.

He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd
accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended
to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card
was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he
wasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.

Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,
fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third
rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the
classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for
all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.

Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the
centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to
the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's
profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets
quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who
must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and
usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent
hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long
denied him.

Si was going to do it differently this time.

Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The
works. But nothing but the best.

To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable
retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he
attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.
A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In
the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever
performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't
needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,
titles.

Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit
card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the
auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the
screen and said, ""Balance check, please.""

In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, ""Ten shares of
Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four
thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents
apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars."" The
screen went dead.

One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely
spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it
would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he
wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond
was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.

He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube
two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down
the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one
place really made sense. The big city.

He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore
and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He
might as well do it up brown.

He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his
car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot
controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his
destination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on
the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry
he'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity
gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.

""Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,"" he said aloud.

The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the
shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could
refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the
direction of the pressure was reversed.

Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing
sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the
canopy and stepped into his hotel room.

A voice said gently, ""If the quarters are satisfactory, please present
your credit card within ten minutes.""

Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most
swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size
the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to
the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the
Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched
the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.

He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining
table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,
he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine
or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he
managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.

He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped
himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness
he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that
direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the
mattress.

He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it
fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it
against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that
registration could be completed.

For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it
easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars
around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.
This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in
the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.

He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink
at the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a
dime a dozen.

He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,
""Kudos Room.""

The auto-elevator murmured politely, ""Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.""

At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a
moment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.
However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was
going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made
his way to the bar.

There was actually a bartender.

Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an
air of easy sophistication, ""Slivovitz Sour.""

""Yes, sir.""

The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed
they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.
He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the
drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so
as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.

Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd
dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining
conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up
to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to
take a look at the others present.

To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None
that he placed, at least--top teevee stars, top politicians of the
Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.
",spaceman_spree,reynolds,1963,1,1057
"
He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl
who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked
and then swallowed.

""_Zo-ro-as-ter_,"" he breathed.

She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of
having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her
eyes. Every pore, but _every_ pore, was in place. She sat with the easy
grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.

His stare couldn't be ignored.

She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, ""A Far
Out Cooler, please, Fredric."" Then deliberately added, ""I thought the
Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.""

There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about
building the drink.

Si cleared his throat. ""Hey,"" he said, ""how about letting this one be
on me?""

Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her
Oriental motif, rose. ""Really!"" she said, drawing it out.

The bartender said hurriedly, ""I beg your pardon, sir....""

The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, ""Why, isn't that a
space pin?""

Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, ""Yeah ... sure.""

""Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?""

""Sure."" He pointed at the lapel pin. ""You can't wear one unless you
been on at least a Moon run.""

She was obviously both taken back and impressed. ""Why,"" she said,
""you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave
you.""

Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. ""Call me
Si,"" he said. ""Everybody calls me Si.""

She said, ""I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting
Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.""

""Si,"" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything
like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the
current sex symbols, but never in person. ""Call me Si,"" he said again.
""I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to
if they say Seymour.""

""I cried when they gave you that antique watch,"" she said, her tone
such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having
met him.

Si Pond was surprised. ""Cried?"" he said. ""Well, why? I was kind of
bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under
him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.""

""_Academician_ Gubelin?"" she said. ""You just call him _Doc_?""

Si was expansive. ""Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have
much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like
that. But how come you cried?""

She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,
as though avoiding his face. ""I ... I suppose it was that speech
Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in
your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the
planets....""

""Well,"" Si said modestly, ""two of my runs were only to the Moon.""

""... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And
the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact
that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole
world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.""

Si grunted. ""Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to
take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be
dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning
Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,
it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.
So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to
pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration
Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their
ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those
spaceships costs?""
",spaceman_spree,reynolds,1963,1,685
"
""Funny?"" she said. ""Why, I don't think it's funny at all.""

Si said, ""Look, how about another drink?""

Natalie Paskov said, ""Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....""

""Si,"" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of
the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. ""How come you
know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested
in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.
Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of
materials and all and keep the economy going.""

Natalie said earnestly, ""Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've
read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots
and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd
say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.""

Si chuckled. ""A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was
never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested
after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.""

She frowned. ""I don't believe I know much about that.""

Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had
ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. ""Old Gubelin
keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper
articles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration
already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed
tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's
precious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man
aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole
flock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard,
but...."" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic
and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.

He cleared his throat. ""Let's talk about some other angle. Look, how
about something to eat, Natalie? I'm celebrating my retirement, like.
You know, out on the town. If you're free....""

She put the tip of a finger to her lips, looking for the moment like a
small girl rather than an ultra-sophisticate. ""Supposedly, I have an
appointment,"" she said hesitantly.

When the mists rolled out in the morning--if it was still morning--it
was to the tune of an insistent hotel chime. Si rolled over on his back
and growled, ""_Zo-ro-as-ter_, cut that out. What do you want?""

The hotel communicator said softly, ""Checking-out time, sir, is at two
o'clock.""

Si groaned. He couldn't place the last of the evening at all. He didn't
remember coming back to the hotel. He couldn't recall where he had
separated from, what was her name ... Natalie.

He vaguely recalled having some absinthe in some fancy club she had
taken him to. What was the gag she'd made? Absinthe makes the heart
grow fonder. And then the club where they had the gambling machines.
And the mists had rolled in on him. Mountains of the Moon! but that
girl could drink. He simply wasn't that used to the stuff. You don't
drink in Space School and you most certainly don't drink when in space.
His binges had been few and far between.

He said now, ""I don't plan on checking out today. Don't bother me."" He
turned to his pillow.

The hotel communicator said quietly, ""Sorry, sir, but your credit
balance does not show sufficient to pay your bill for another day.""

Si Pond shot up, upright in bed, suddenly cold sober.

His eyes darted about the room, as though he was seeing it for
the first time. His clothes, he noted, were thrown over a chair
haphazardly. He made his way to them, his face empty, and fished about
for his credit card, finding it in a side pocket. He wavered to the
teevee-phone and thrust the card against the screen. He demanded, his
voice as empty as his expression, ""Balance check, please.""

In less than a minute the robot-voice told him: ""Ten shares of
Inalienable Basic. Current cash credit, forty-two dollars and thirty
cents."" The screen went dead.

He sank back into the chair which held his clothes, paying no attention
to them. It couldn't be right. Only yesterday, he'd had twelve shares
of Variable Basic, immediately convertible into more than fifty
thousand dollars, had he so wished to convert rather than collect
dividends indefinitely. Not only had he the twelve shares of Variable
Basic, but more than a thousand dollars to his credit.

He banged his fist against his mouth. Conceivably, he might have
gone through his thousand dollars. It was possible, though hardly
believable. The places he'd gone to with that girl in the Chinese
get-up were probably the most expensive in Greater Metropolis. But,
however expensive, he couldn't possibly have spent fifty thousand
dollars! Not possibly.

He came to his feet again to head for the teevee screen and demand
an audit of the past twenty-four hours from Central Statistics.
That'd show it up. Every penny expended. Something was crazy here.
Someway that girl had pulled a fast one. She didn't seem the type. But
something had happened to his twelve shares of Variable Basic, and
he wasn't standing for it. It was his security, his defense against
slipping back into the ranks of the cloddies, the poor demi-buttocked
ranks of the average man, the desperately dull life of those who
subsisted on the bounty of the Ultrawelfare State and the proceeds of
ten shares of Inalienable Basic.

He dialed Statistics and placed his card against the screen. His
voice was strained now. ""An audit of all expenditures for the past
twenty-four hours.""

Then he sat and watched.
",spaceman_spree,reynolds,1963,1,978
"
His vacuum-tube trip to Manhattan was the first item. Two dollars and
fifty cents. Next was his hotel suite. Fifty dollars. Well, he had
known it was going to be expensive. A Slivovitz Sour at the Kudos Room,
he found, went for three dollars a throw, and the Far out Coolers
Natalie drank, four dollars. Absinthe was worse still, going for ten
dollars a drink.

He was impatient. All this didn't account for anything like a thousand
dollars, not to speak of fifty thousand.

The audit threw an item he didn't understand. A one dollar credit. And
then, immediately afterward, a hundred dollar credit. Si scowled.

And then slowly reached out and flicked the set off. For it had all
come back to him.

At first he had won. Won so that the other players had crowded around
him, watching. Five thousand, ten thousand. Natalie had been jubilant.
The others had cheered him on. He'd bet progressively higher, smaller
wagers becoming meaningless and thousands being involved on single
bets. A five thousand bet on odd had lost, and then another. The
kibitzers had gone silent. When he had attempted to place another
five thousand bet, the teevee screen robot voice had informed him
dispassionately that his current cash credit balance was insufficient
to cover that amount.

Yes. He could remember now. He had needed no time to decide, had simply
snapped, ""Sell one share of Variable Basic at current market value.""

The other eleven shares had taken the route of the first.

When it was finally all gone and he had looked around, it was to find
that Natalie Paskov was gone as well.

Academician Lofting Gubelin, seated in his office, was being
pontifical. His old friend Hans Girard-Perregaux had enough other
things on his mind to let him get away with it, only half following the
monologue.

""I submit,"" Gubelin orated, ""that there is evolution in society. But
it is by fits and starts, and by no means a constant thing. Whole
civilizations can go dormant, so far as progress is concerned, for
millennia at a time.""

Girard-Perregaux said mildly, ""Isn't that an exaggeration, Lofting?""

""No, by Zoroaster, it is not! Take the Egyptians. Their greatest
monuments, such as the pyramids, were constructed in the earlier
dynasties. Khufu, or Cheops, built the largest at Gizeh. He was the
founder of the 4th Dynasty, about the year 2900 B. C. Twenty-five
dynasties later, and nearly three thousand years, there was no greatly
discernable change in the Egyptian culture.""

Girard-Perregaux egged him on gently. ""The sole example of your theory
I can think of, offhand.""

""Not at all!"" Gubelin glared. ""The Mayans are a more recent proof.
Their culture goes back to at least 500 B. C. At that time their
glyph-writing was already wide-spread and their cities, eventually
to number in the hundreds, being built. By the time of Christ they
had reached their peak. And they remained there until the coming of
the Spaniards, neither gaining nor losing, in terms of evolution of
society.""

His colleague sighed. ""And your point, Lofting?""

""Isn't it blisteringly obvious?"" the other demanded. ""We're in danger
of reaching a similar static condition here and now. The Ultrawelfare
State!"" He snorted indignation. ""The Conformist State or the Status
Quo State, is more like it. I tell you, Hans, all progress is being
dried up. There is no will to delve into the unknown, no burning fever
to explore the unexplored. And this time it isn't a matter of a single
area, such as Egypt or Yucatan, but our whole world. If man goes into
intellectual coma this time, then all the race slows down, not merely a
single element of it.""

He rose suddenly from the desk chair he'd been occupying to pace the
room. ""The race must find a new frontier, a new ocean to cross, a new
enemy to fight.""

Girard-Perregaux raised his eyebrows.

""Don't be a cloddy,"" Gubelin snapped. ""You know what I mean. Not a
human enemy, not even an alien intelligence. But something against
which we must pit our every wit, our every strength, our strongest
determination. Otherwise, we go dull, we wither on the vine.""

The other at long last chuckled. ""My dear Lofting, you wax absolutely
lyrical.""

Gubelin suddenly stopped his pacing, returned to his desk and sank
back into his chair. He seemed to add a score of years to his age, and
his face sagged. ""I don't know why I take it out on you, Hans. You're
as aware of the situation as I. Man's next frontier is space. First
the planets, and then a reaching out to the stars. This is our new
frontier, our new ocean to cross.""

His old friend was nodding. He brought his full attention to the
discussion at last. ""And we'll succeed, Lofting. The last trip Pond
made gives us ample evidence that we can actually colonize and
exploit the Jupiter satellites. Two more runs, at most three, and
we can release our findings in such manner that they'll strike the
imaginations of every Tom, Dick and Harry like nothing since Columbus
made his highly exaggerated reports on his New World.""

""Two or three more runs,"" Gubelin grunted bitterly. ""You've heard the
rumors. Appropriations is going to lower the boom on us. Unless we can
get Pond back into harness, we're sunk. The runs will never be made. I
tell you, Hans....""

But Hans Girard-Perregaux was wagging him to silence with a finger.
""They'll be made. I've taken steps to see friend Seymour Pond comes
dragging back to us.""

""But he _hates_ space! The funker probably won't consent to come within
a mile of the New Albuquerque Spaceport for the rest of his life, the
blistering cloddy.""

A desk light flicked green, and Girard-Perregaux raised his eyebrows.
""Exactly at the psychological moment. If I'm not mistaken, Lofting,
that is probably our fallen woman.""

""Our _what_?""
",spaceman_spree,reynolds,1963,1,985
"
""ALL ABOARD!""

A metallic voice rasped over the loud-speakers and echoed through the
lofty marble and aluminum concourse of the New Chicago Monorail
Terminal. ""Atom City express on Track Seven! Space Academy first stop!
Passengers for Space Academy will please take seats in the first six
cars!""

As the crowd of people waiting in the concourse surged through the gate
leading to Track Seven, three boys in the royal-blue uniforms of the
Space Cadet Corps slowly picked up their plastic space bags and joined
the mass of travelers.

Wearily, they drifted with the crowd and stepped on the slidestairs
leading down to the monorail platform. In the lead, Tom Corbett, the
command cadet of the unit, a tall, curly-haired boy of eighteen,
slouched against the handrail and looked back at his two unit-mates,
Roger Manning and Astro. Manning, a slender cadet, with close-cropped
blond hair, was yawning and blinking his eyes sleepily, while Astro, the
third member of the unit, a head taller than either of his unit-mates
and fifty pounds heavier, stood flat-footed on the step, eyes closed,
his giant bulk swaying slightly with the motion of the slidestairs.

""Huh! A real snappy unit!"" Tom muttered to himself.

""Hmmm? What?"" Roger blinked and stared bleary-eyed at Tom.

""Nothing, Roger,"" Tom replied. ""I only hope you guys can stay awake long
enough to get on the monorail.""

""It's your own fault, Tom,"" rumbled Astro in his bull-like voice. ""If
your family hadn't thrown so many parties for us while we were on leave,
we'd have had more sleep.""

""I didn't hear any complaints then,"" snorted Tom. ""Just get into the car
before you cork off, will you? I'm in no shape to carry you.""

Seconds later, the slidestairs deposited the three boys on the platform
and they slowly made their way through the crowd toward the forward cars
of the monorail. Entering the third car, they found three seats together
and collapsed into their luxurious softness.

""Oh, brother!"" Tom groaned as he curled himself into the cushions, ""I'm
going to sleep all the way to the Academy.""

""I'm asleep already,"" mumbled Roger, his voice muffled by his cap pulled
low over his face.

Suddenly Astro sat bolt upright. ""I'm hungry!"" he announced.

""Oh, no!"" moaned Tom.

""Why, you overgrown Venusian ape, Mrs. Corbett gave you dinner less than
an hour ago!"" Roger complained. ""Steak, French fries, beans, corn, pie,
ice cream....""

""Two helpings,"" chimed in Tom.

""And now you're hungry!"" Roger was incredulous.

""Can't help it,"" calmly answered Astro. ""I'm a big guy, that's all."" He
began digging through his space bag for an apple Mrs. Corbett had
thoughtfully provided.

Tom finally stirred and sat up. He had learned a long time ago the
futility of trying to deny Astro's Gargantuan appetite. ""There's a
dining car on this section of the monorail, Astro,"" he said, slapping a
crumpled mass of credits into the Venusian's hamlike hand. ""Here. Have
yourself a good time."" He slumped back in his seat and closed his eyes.

""Yeah,"" growled Roger, ""and when you come back, don't make any noise!""

Astro smiled. He got up carefully and climbed over his two sleeping
mates. Standing in the aisle, he counted the credits Tom had given him
and turned to the front of the car. Suddenly a heavy voice growled
behind him.

""One side, spaceboy!""

A hand grabbed him by the shoulder and pushed him to one side. Caught
off balance, Astro fell back on his sleeping unit-mates.

""Hey! What th--"" stuttered Astro as he sprawled on top of his friends.
The two sleepy cadets came up howling.

""Astro! What in blazes do you think you're doing?"" roared Tom.

""Why, you space-brained idiot,"" yelled Roger, ""I ought to lay one on
your chin!""

There was a tangle of arms and legs and finally the three cadets
struggled to their feet. Astro turned to see who had pushed him.

Two men standing at the end of the car grinned back at him.

""It was those two guys at the end of the car,"" explained Astro. ""They
pushed me!"" He lumbered toward them, followed by Tom and Roger.

Stopping squarely in front of them, he demanded, ""What's the big idea?""

""Go back to your beauty rest, spaceboy!"" jeered the heavier of the two
men and turned to his companion, adding with a snarl, ""How do you like
his nerve? We not only have to pay taxes to support these lazy kids and
teach them how to be spacemen, but they're loud-mouthed and sassy on top
of it!""

The other man, smaller and rat-faced, laughed. ""Yeah, we oughta report
them to their little soldier bosses at Space Academy.""

Astro suddenly balled his fists and stepped forward, but Tom grabbed his
arm and pulled him back while Roger eased himself between his mates and
the two grinning men.

""You know, Tom,"" he drawled, looking the heavier of the two right in the
eye, ""the only thing I don't like about being a Space Cadet is having to
be polite to _all_ the people, including the space crawlers!""

""Why, you little punk,"" sneered the bigger man, ""I oughta wipe up the
deck with you!""

Roger smiled thinly. ""Don't try it, mister. You wouldn't know what hit
you!""

""Come on, Wallace,"" said the smaller man. ""Leave 'em alone and let's
go.""

Astro took another step forward and roared, ""Blast off. Both of you!""

The two men turned quickly and disappeared through the door leading to
the next monorail car.

The three cadets turned and headed back down the aisle to their seats.

""Let's get some sleep,"" said Tom. ""We better be in good shape for that
new assignment when we hit the Academy. No telling what it'll be, where
we'll go, or worse yet, when we'll blast off. And I, for one, want to
have a good night's rest under my belt.""

""Yeah,"" agreed Roger, settling himself into the cushions once more.
""Wonder what the orders will be. Got any ideas, Tom?""

""No idea at all, Roger,"" answered Tom. ""The audiogram just said report
back to the Academy immediately for assignment.""

""Hey, Astro!"" exclaimed Roger, seeing the Venusian climb back into his
seat. ""Aren't you going to eat?""

""I'm not hungry any more,"" grunted Astro. ""Those guys made me lose my
appetite.""

Tom looked at Roger and winked. ""Maybe we'd better tell Captain Strong
about this, Roger.""

""Why?""

""Get Astro mad enough and he won't want to eat. The Academy can cut down
on its food bills.""

""Ah, rocket off, you guys,"" growled Astro sleepily.

Tom and Roger smiled at each other, closed their eyes, and in a moment
the three cadets of the Polaris unit were sound asleep.
",space_pirates,rockwell,1953,1,1115
"
Suspended from a single gleaming rail that stretched across the western
plains like an endless silver ribbon, the monorail express hurtled
through the early dawn speeding its passengers to their destination. As
the gleaming line of streamlined cars crossed the newly developed
grazing lands that had once been the great American desert, Tom Corbett
stirred from a deep sleep. The slanting rays of the morning sun were
shining in his eyes. Tom yawned, stretched, and turned to the viewport
to watch the scenery flash past. Looming up over the flat grassy plains
ahead, he could see a huge bluish mountain range, its many peaks covered
with ever-present snow. In a few moments Tom knew the train would rocket
through a tunnel and then on the other side, in the center of a deep,
wide valley, he would see Space Academy, the university of the planets
and headquarters of the great Solar Guard.

He reached over and shook Roger and Astro, calling, ""All right,
spacemen, time to hit the deck!""

""Uh? Ah-ummmh!"" groaned Roger.

""Ahhhoooohhhhhh!"" yawned Astro. Standing up, he stretched and touched
the top of the monorail car.

""Let's get washed before the other passengers wake up,"" said Tom, and
headed for the morning room. Astro and Roger followed, dragging their
feet and rubbing their eyes.

Five minutes later, as the sleek monorail whistled into the tunnel
beneath the mountain range, the boys of the _Polaris_ unit returned to
their seats.

""Back to the old grind,"" sighed Roger. ""Drills, maneuvers, books,
lectures. The same routine, day in day out.""

""Maybe not,"" said Tom. ""Remember, the order for us to report back was
signed by Commander Walters, not the cadet supervisor of leaves. I think
that means something special.""

Suddenly the monorail roared out of the tunnel and into brilliant
early-morning sun again.

The three cadets turned quickly, their eyes sweeping the valley for the
first sight of the shining Tower of Galileo.

""There it is,"" said Tom, pointing toward a towering crystal building
reflecting the morning light. ""We'll be there in a minute.""

Even as Tom spoke, the speed of the monorail slackened as it eased past
a few gleaming structures of aluminum and concrete. Presently the white
platform of the Academy station drifted past the viewport and all
forward motion stopped. The doors opened and the three boys hurried to
the exit.

All around the cadets, men and women in the vari-colored uniforms of the
Solar Guard hurried through the station. The green of the Earthworm
cadets, first-year students of the Cadet Corps; the brilliant rich blue
of the senior cadets like the _Polaris_ unit; the scarlet red of the
enlisted Solar Guard; and here and there, the black and gold of the
officers of the Solar Guard.

The three cadets hurried to the nearest slidewalk, a moving belt of
plastic that glided silently across the ground toward Space Academy. It
whisked them quickly past the few buildings nestled around the monorail
station and rounded a curve. The three cadets looked up together at the
gleaming Tower of Galileo. Made of pure Titan crystal, it soared above
the cluster of buildings that surrounded the grassy quadrangle and
dominated Space Academy like a translucent giant.

The cadets stepped off the slidewalk as it glided past the Tower
building and ran up the broad marble stair. At the huge main portal, Tom
stopped and looked back over the Academy grounds. All around him lay the
evidence of mankind's progress. It was the year 2353, when Earthman had
long since colonized the inner planets, Mars and Venus, and the three
large satellites, Moon of Earth, Ganymede of Jupiter, and Titan of
Saturn. It was the age of space travel; of the Solar Alliance, a unified
society of billions of people who lived in peace with one another,
though sprawled throughout the universe; and the Solar Guard, the might
of the Solar Alliance and the defender of interplanetary peace. All
these things Tom saw as he stood in the wide portal of the Tower
Building, flanked by Astro and Roger.

Turning into the Tower, the three cadets went directly to the office of
their unit commander. The training program at Space Academy consisted of
three cadets to a unit, with a Solar Guard officer as their teacher and
instructor. Steve Strong, captain in the Solar Guard, had been their
cadet instructor since the unit had been formed and he now smiled a
welcome as the cadets snapped to attention in front of his desk.

""_Polaris_ unit reporting as ordered, sir,"" said Tom, handing over the
audiogram order he had received the day before.

""Thank you, Corbett,"" said Strong, taking the paper. ""At ease.""

The three boys relaxed and broke into wide grins as Strong rounded his
desk and shook hands with each of them.

""Glad to have you back, boys,"" he said. ""Did you enjoy your leave?""

""And how, sir,"" replied Tom.

""Tom's mother showed us a whale of a good time,"" chimed in Roger.

""And how she can cook!"" Astro licked his lips involuntarily.

""Well, I hope you had a good rest--"" said Strong, but was suddenly
interrupted by the sound of a small bell. Behind his desk a small
teleceiver screen glowed into life to reveal the stern face of Commander
Walters, the commander of Space Academy.

Strong turned to the teleceiver and called, ""Yes, Commander Walters?""

""Did the _Polaris_ unit arrive yet, Steve?"" asked the commander.

""Yes, sir,"" replied Strong. ""They're here in my office now, sir.""

""Good,"" said the commander with a smile. ""I just received a report the
exposition will open sooner than expected. I suggest you brief the
cadets and raise ship as soon as possible.""

""Very well, sir,"" answered Strong. The screen darkened and he turned
back to the cadets. ""Looks like you got back just in time.""

""What's up, sir?"" asked Tom.

Strong returned to his chair and sat down. ""I suppose you've all heard
about the Solar Exposition that opens on Venus next week?""

Tom's eyes lit up. ""Have we! That's all the stereos and visunews and
teleceivers have been yacking about for weeks now.""

""Well,"" said Strong with a smile, ""we're going!""

The three cadets couldn't restrain themselves and burst out in a happy
shout. Then Roger calmed down enough to comment, ""Sounds more like
another vacation than an assignment, sir.""

""Hardly, Manning,"" replied Strong. ""You see, every industry, society,
organization, and governmental agency is setting up exhibits at the
exposition to show the people what's taking place in their part of the
solar system. There'll also be an amusement section."" Strong chuckled.
""I've seen pictures of some of the tricks and rides they've developed to
entertain the younger generation. Believe me, I'd rather take full
acceleration on a rocket ship than ride on any of them.""
",space_pirates,rockwell,1953,1,1134
"
""But what will we do, sir?"" asked Tom.

""Our job is very simple. We're to take the _Polaris_ to the exposition
and land on the fairgrounds. When the fair opens, we show all the
visitors who are interested, everything about her.""

""You mean we're going to be""--Roger swallowed--""guides?""

""That's right, Manning,"" said Strong. ""You three will guide all visitors
through the _Polaris_.""

""How long will we be there, sir?"" asked Tom.

""A month or so, I guess. The _Polaris_ will be the first Academy
exhibit. When you leave, another unit will replace you with their ship
and do the same thing.""

""But--but--"" stammered Astro, ""what will we say to them? The visitors, I
mean?""

""Just answer all their questions, Astro. Also, make up a little speech
about the functions of your particular station.""

Strong looked at his watch and rose to his feet. ""It's getting late.
Check the _Polaris_ over and stand by to raise ship in an hour.""

""Yes, sir,"" said Tom.

The cadets came to attention, preparing to leave.

""One thing more! Don't get the idea that this is going to be a space
lark,"" said Strong. ""It's very important for the people of the Solar
Alliance to know what kind of work we're doing here at the Academy. And
you three have been selected as representatives of the entire Cadet
Corps. So see that you conduct yourselves accordingly. All right,
dismissed!""

The three cadets saluted sharply and filed out of the room, their
skipper's final words ringing in their ears.

Fifteen minutes later, having packed the necessary gear for the extended
trip, the _Polaris_ unit rode the slidewalk through the grassy
quadrangle and the cluster of Academy buildings, out toward the
spaceport. In the distance they could see the rocket cruiser _Polaris_,
poised on the launching ramp, her long silhouette outlined sharply
against the blue sky. Resting on her four stabilizer fins, her nose
pointed toward the stars, the ship looked like a giant projectile poised
and ready to blast its target.

""Look at her!"" exclaimed Astro. ""If she isn't the most beautiful ship in
the universe, I'll eat my hat.""

""Don't see how you could,"" drawled Roger, ""after the way you put away
Mrs. Corbett's pies!""

Tom laughed. ""I'll tell you one thing, Roger,"" he said, pointing to the
ship, ""I feel like that baby is as much my home as Mom's and Dad's house
back in New Chicago.""

""All right, all right,"" said Roger. ""Since we're all getting sloppy, I
have to admit that I'm glad to see that old thrust bucket too!""

Presently the three cadets were scrambling into the mighty spaceship,
and they went right to work, preparing for blast-off.

Quickly, with sure hands, each began a systematic check of his station.
On the power deck Astro, a former enlisted Solar Guardsman who had been
admitted to the Cadet Corps because of his engineering genius, stripped
to the waist and started working on the ship's massive atomic engines. A
heavy rocketman's belt of tools slung around his waist, he crawled
through the heart of the ship, adjusting a valve here, turning a screw
there, seeing that the reactant feeders were clean and clear to the
rocket firing chambers. And last of all he made sure the great rocket
firing chambers were secure and the heavy sheets of lead baffling in
place to protect him from deadly radioactivity.

On the radar bridge in the nose of the ship, Roger removed the delicate
astrogation prism from its housing and cleaned it with a soft cloth.
Replacing it carefully, he turned to the radar scanner, checking the
intricate wiring system and making sure that the range finders were in
good working order. He then turned his attention to the intercom.

""Radar bridge to control deck,"" he called. ""Checking the intercom, Tom.""

Immediately below, on the control deck, Tom turned away from the control
panel. ""All clear here, Roger. Check with Astro.""

""All clear on the power deck!"" The big Venusian's voice boomed over the
loud-speaker. The intercom could be heard all over the ship unless the
many speakers were turned off individually.
",space_pirates,rockwell,1953,1,686
"
Tom turned his attention back to the great control panel, and one by one
tested the banks of dials, gauges, and indicators that controlled the
rocket cruiser. Tom Corbett had wanted to be a space Cadet as long as he
could remember. After taking the entrance exams, he had been accepted
for the rigid training that would prepare him to enter the ranks of the
great Solar Guard. He had met his two unit-mates, Roger and Astro, on
his very first day at the Academy, and after a difficult beginning,
adjusting to each other's personalities and the discipline of the
Academy routine, the three boys had become steadfast friends.

As control-deck cadet and pilot, Tom was head of the unit,
second-in-command to Captain Strong. And while he could issue orders to
Astro and Roger and expect to be obeyed, the three cadets all spoke
their minds when it came to making difficult decisions. This had
solidified the three cadets into a fighting, experienced, dependable
unit.

Tom made a final check on the gravity generator and turned to the
intercom.

""All departments, report!"" he called.

""Radar bridge checks in O.K.,"" replied Roger.

""Power deck checks in on the nose, Tom,"" reported Astro.

""Right! Stand by! We blast as soon as the skipper gets around.""

Tom turned to the teleceiver and switched it on. The screen blurred and
then steadied into a view of the spaceport outside. Tom scanned the
launching ramp below, and, satisfied it was clear, he switched the
teleceiver to the spaceport traffic-control circuit.

""Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to spaceport control,"" he called. ""Come in,
spaceport control. Request orbit clearance.""

""Spaceport traffic control to _Polaris_,"" reported the traffic officer,
his face in focus on the teleceiver screen. ""Your orbit has been cleared
for blast-off. Orbit number 3847--repeat, 3847--raise ship when ready!""

""Orbit 3847,"" repeated Tom. ""End transmission!""

""End transmission,"" said the officer. Tom flipped off the teleceiver and
the officer's face disappeared.

At the rear of the control deck, Captain Strong suddenly stepped through
the hatch and dropped his black plastic space bag on the deck. Tom got
up and saluted sharply.

""_Polaris_ ready to blast off, sir,"" he said. ""Orbit cleared.""

""Very well, Corbett,"" replied Strong, returning the salute. ""Carry on!""

Tom turned back to the control board and flipped on the intercom.
""Control deck to power deck! Energize the cooling pumps!""

""Cooling pumps, aye!"" said Astro.

From the power deck, the massive pumps began their whining roar. The
great ship shuddered under the pressure.

Tom watched the gauge that indicated the pressure control and then
called into the intercom.

""Radar bridge, do we have a clear trajectory?'

""All clear forward and up, Tom,"" reported Roger from the radar bridge.

""Strap in for blast-off!"" bawled the curly-haired cadet.

Captain Strong took his place in the pilot's chair next to Tom and
strapping himself in snapped out, ""Feed reactant!""

Spinning a small wheel at the side of the control panel, Tom reported,
""Feeders at D-9 rate, sir!""

Then, as the hiss of fuel pouring into the mighty engines of the ship
blended with the whine of the pumps, Tom snapped out a third order. ""Cut
in take-off six yards!""

Receiving acknowledgment from below, he grasped the master blast-off
switch and watched the sweeping hand of the astral chronometer.

""Stand by to raise ship!"" he yelled. ""Blast off
minus--five--four--three--two--one--_zero_!""

He pulled the switch.

Slowly, the rockets blasting evenly, the giant ship lifted itself free
of the ground. Then, gaining speed, it began rocketing away from the
Earth. Like a giant shining bullet, the great spaceship blasted through
the dark void of space, her nose pointed to the distant misty planet of
Venus.

Once again Tom Corbett and his unit-mates had embarked on a mission for
the Solar Guard.
",space_pirates,rockwell,1953,1,627
"


""Stand by for touchdown!"" bellowed Captain Strong's voice on the big
spaceship's intercom.

""Control deck standing by,"" replied Tom.

""Corbett,"" Strong continued, ""you may take her down as soon as you get
clearance from Venusport traffic control.""

Tom acknowledged the order with a brisk ""Aye, sir! In a few moments he
received permission to touch down on the newly colonized planet. Then,
turning his attention to the control board, he requested a
ground-approach check from Roger.

""About two miles to touchdown, Tom,"" reported Roger from the radar
bridge. ""Trajectory clear!""

""O.K., Roger,"" said Tom. Glancing quickly at the air speed and rocket
thrust indicators, he flipped a switch and sang out, ""Power deck, reduce
thrust on main drive rockets to minimum!""

""Got ya, Tom,"" boomed Astro.

""Closing in fast, sir,"" said Tom to Strong, who had come up from below
and now stood at the cadet's shoulder watching as Tom maneuvered the big
ship through the Venusian atmosphere, his keen eyes sweeping the great
panel of recording gauges and dials.

""One thousand feet to touchdown,"" intoned Roger from the radar bridge.

Reacting swiftly, Tom adjusted several levers, then picking up the
intercom microphone, he threw a switch and yelled, ""Power deck! Full
braking thrust!""

Deep inside the _Polaris_, Astro, who tended the mighty rocket power
plant with loving care, eased home the sensitive control mechanism,
applying even pressure to the braking rockets.

As the giant spaceship settled smoothly to within a few feet of the
surface of the concrete spaceport, Tom threw the master switch that cut
all power. A moment later the huge craft dropped easily, then settled on
the landing platform with a gentle thump.

""Touchdown!"" yelled Tom. Then, glancing at the astral chronometer on the
control board, he turned to Strong, and saluting smartly, reported,
""_Polaris_ completes space flight at exactly seven fifty-two-O-two!""

Strong returned the salute. ""Very well, Tom. Now, I want you, Roger, and
Astro to come with me to the exposition commissioner's office for an
interview and detailed orders.""

""Yes, sir,"" said Tom.

A few minutes later, dressed in fresh uniforms, the three cadets
followed their unit commander out of the ship, then stood by as Strong
ordered the chief petty officer of an enlisted Solar Guard working party
to prepare the _Polaris_ for moving to the exposition site.

""Empty the reactant fuel tanks of all but enough for us to raise ship
and touch down over to the fairgrounds,"" said Strong. ""Better strip her
of armament, too. Paralo-ray pistols and rifles, the three-inch and
six-inch atomic blasters, narco sleeping gas; in fact, everything that
could possibly cause any trouble.""

""Yes, sir,"" replied the scarlet-clad enlisted spaceman.

""One thing more,"" added Strong. ""There will be a crew living aboard, so
please see that the galley is stocked with a full supply of both fresh
and synthetic foods. That's about all, I guess.""

""Very well, sir,"" replied the petty officer with a crisp salute. He
turned and began bawling orders to a squad of men behind him and
immediately they were swarming over the great ship like ants.

Fifteen minutes later, a jet cab swerved to a stop in front of the
tallest of the Venusport buildings, the Solar Alliance Chamber. Strong
paid the driver, adding a handsome tip, and flanked by his three cadets
strode briskly into the building.

Crossing a high-ceilinged lobby, they entered an express vacuum elevator
and five seconds later stepped out onto the four-hundredth floor. There,
Strong slid a panel door to one side, and, followed by the cadets,
stepped inside the office of Mike Hawks, exposition commissioner and
retired senior officer of the Solar Guard.

The office was impressively large and airy, with an outside wall forming
a viewport of clear Titan crystal reaching from floor to vaulted ceiling
and affording a magnificent view of the city of Venusport and, beyond
it, the futuristic buildings of the exposition itself. Another wall,
equally as large, was covered by a map of the exposition grounds.

Mike Hawks, a man with steel-gray hair, clear blue eyes, and a ramrod
military bearing, sat behind a massive desk talking to two men. He
looked up when Strong and the cadets walked in and rose quickly with a
broad smile to greet them.

""Steve!"" he exclaimed, rounding the desk to shake hands with his old
friend. ""I never dreamed we'd have you and the _Polaris_ unit at our
fair!"" He nodded warmly to the cadets who stood at rigid attention. ""At
ease, cadets. Glad to have you aboard.""

""I was just as surprised to get this assignment, Mike,"" said Strong,
pumping the officer's hand. Nodding toward the men seated in front of
Hawks' desk, he apologized, ""Sorry to bust in on you like this, old man.
Didn't know you were busy.""

""It's quite all right."" The commissioner smiled. ""Just handing out a few
licenses for the concessions in the amusement section at the fair.
People expect to have a little fun when they go to a fair, you know. By
the stars, they're going to have it so long as I'm commissioner."" He
turned to the cadets. ""Sit down, boys. You too, Steve. I'll be with you
in a minute."" He turned back to his desk and the waiting men.

The cadets, at a nod from Strong, sat down on a leather couch that
stretched the length of one wall and listened while Hawks completed his
business with the two men.

""There you are,"" said Hawks, applying the seal of his office to a slip
of paper. ""That gives you the right to operate a concession in the
amusement area as long as the fair is open.""

One of the men took the paper and glanced at it quickly.

""Wait a minute, Commissioner. This is over near the edge of the area,""
he complained. ""We wanted to get in the middle. How do you expect us to
make any credits away out there by ourselves?"" The man's tone was surly
and disrespectful.

""Sorry, but that's the only location left. In fact,"" Hawks added acidly,
""you're lucky to get it!""

""Really?"" sneered the heavier of the two. ""Well, I'm sure going to find
out about this!""
",space_pirates,rockwell,1953,1,1030
"

""Emergency air lock open!""

The tall, broad-shouldered officer, wearing the magnificent
black-and-gold uniform of the Solar Guard, spoke into a small microphone
and waited for an acknowledgment. It came almost immediately.

""Cadet Corbett ready for testing,"" a voice crackled thinly over the
loud-speaker.

""Very well. Proceed.""

Seated in front of the scanner screen on the control deck of the rocket
cruiser _Polaris_, Captain Steve Strong replaced the microphone in its
slot and watched a bulky figure in a space suit step out of the air lock
and drift away from the side of the ship. Behind him, five boys, all
dressed in the vivid blue uniforms of the Space Cadet Corps, strained
forward to watch the lone figure adjust the nozzles of the jet unit on
the back of his space suit.

""Come on, Tom!"" said the biggest of the five boys, his voice a low,
powerful rumble as he rooted for his unit mate.

""If Tom makes this one,"" crowed the cadet next to him, a slender boy
with a thick shock of close-cropped blond hair, ""the _Polaris_ unit is
home free!""

""This is the last test, Manning,"" replied one of the remaining three
cadets, the insigne of the _Arcturus_ unit on the sleeve of his uniform.
""_If_ Corbett makes this one, you fellows deserve to win.""

Aboard the rocket cruiser _Polaris_, blasting through the black void of
space two hundred miles above Earth, six Space Cadets and a Solar Guard
officer were conducting the final test for unit honors for the term. All
other Academy units had been eliminated in open competition. Now, the
results of the individual space orientation test would decide whether
the three cadets of the _Arcturus_ unit or the three cadets of the
_Polaris_ unit would win final top unit honors.

Roger Manning and Astro kept their eyes glued to the telescanner screen,
watching their unit mate, Tom Corbett, drift slowly through space toward
his starting position. The young cadet's task was basically simple; with
his space helmet blacked out so that he could not see in any direction,
he was to make his way back to the ship from a point a mile away, guided
only by the audio orders from the examining officer aboard the ship. His
score was measured by the time elapsed, and the amount of corrections
and orders given by the examining officer. It was an exercise designed
to test a cadet's steadiness under emergency conditions of space.

The three members of the _Arcturus_ unit had completed their runs and
had returned to the ship in excellent time. Roger and Astro had also
taken their tests and now it depended on Tom. If he could return to the
_Polaris_ in less than ten minutes, with no more than three corrections,
the _Polaris_ unit would be victorious.

Seated directly in front of the scanner, Captain Steve Strong, the
examining officer, watched the space-suited figure dwindle to a mere
speck on the screen. As the regular skipper of the _Polaris_ crew, he
could not help secretly rooting for Tom, but he was determined to be
fair, even to the extent of declaring the _Arcturus_ unit the winner,
should the decision be very close. He leaned forward to adjust the focus
on the scanner, bringing the drifting figure into a close-up view, and
then lifted the microphone to his lips.

""Stand by, Corbett!"" he called. ""You're getting close to range.""

""Very well, sir,"" replied Tom. ""Standing by.""

Behind Strong, Roger and Astro looked at each other and turned back to
the screen. As one, they crossed the fingers of both hands.

""Ready, Corbett!"" called Strong. ""You'll be clocked from the second
you're on range. One hundred feet--seventy-five--fifty--twenty-five
--ten--_time_!""

As the signal echoed in his blacked-out space helmet, Tom jerked his
body around in a sudden violent move, and grasping the valve of the jet
unit on his back, he opened it halfway. He waited, holding his breath,
expecting to hear Captain Strong correct his course. He counted to ten
slowly, and when no correction came over the headphones, he opened the
valve wide and blindly shot through space.

Aboard the Polaris, Astro and Roger shouted with joy and Strong could
not repress a grin. The tiny figure on the scanner was hurtling straight
for the side of the _Polaris_!

As the image grew larger and larger, anxious eyes swiveled back and
forth from the scanner screen to the steady sweeping hand of the
chronometer. Roger bit his lip nervously, and Astro's hands trembled.

When Tom reached a point five hundred feet away from the ship, Strong
flipped open the audio circuit and issued his first order.

""Range five hundred feet,"" he called. ""Cut jets!""

""You're already here, spaceboy!"" yelled Roger into the mike, leaning
over Strong's shoulder. The captain silenced him with a glare. No one
could speak to the examinee but the testing officer.

Tom closed the valve of his jet unit and blindly jerked himself around
again to drift feet first toward the ship. Strong watched this approach
closely, silently admiring the effortless way the cadet handled himself
in weightless space. When Tom was fifty feet away from the ship, and
still traveling quite fast, Strong gave the second order to break his
speed. Tom opened the valve again and felt the tug of the jets braking
his acceleration. He drifted slower and slower, and realizing that he
was close to the hull of the ship, he stretched his legs, striving to
make contact. Seconds later he felt a heavy thump at the soles of his
feet, and within the ship there was the muffled clank of metal boot
weights hitting the metal skin of the hull.

""_Time!_"" roared Strong and glanced at the astral chronometer over his
head. The boys crowded around as the Solar Guard captain quickly
computed Tom's score. ""Nine minutes, fifty-one seconds, and two
corrections,"" he announced, unable to keep the pride out of his voice.

""We win! We win!"" roared Roger. ""Term honors go to the _Polaris_!""

Roger turned around and began pounding Astro on the chest, and the giant
Venusian picked him up and waltzed him around the deck. The three
members of the _Arcturus_ unit waited until the first flush of victory
died away and then crowded around the two boys to congratulate them.

""Don't forget the cadet who did it,"" commented Strong dryly, and the
five cadets rushed below to the jet-boat deck to wait for Tom.

When Tom emerged from the air lock a few moments later, Roger and Astro
swarmed all over him, and another wild dance began. Finally, shaking
free of his well-meaning but violent unit mates, he grinned and gasped,
""Well, from that reception, I guess I did it.""

""Spaceboy""--Roger smiled--""you made the _Arcturus_ unit look like three
old men in a washtub counting toes!""

""Congratulations, Corbett,"" said Tony Richards of the _Arcturus_ crew,
offering his hand. ""That was really fast maneuvering out there.""
",venus_revolt,rockwell,1954,1,1156
"
""Thanks, Tony."" Tom grinned, running his hand through his brown curly
hair. ""But I have to admit I was a little scared. Wow! What a creepy
feeling to know you're out in space alone and not able to see anything.""

Their excitement was interrupted by Strong's voice over the ship's
intercom. ""Stand by, all stations!""

""Here we go!"" shouted Roger. ""Back to the Academy--and leave!""

""_Yeeeeooooow!_"" Astro's bull-like roar echoed through the ship as the
cadets hurried to their flight stations.

As command cadet of the _Polaris_, Tom climbed up to the control deck,
and strapping himself into the command pilot's seat, prepared to get
under way. Astro, the power-deck cadet who could ""take apart a rocket
engine and put it back together again with his thumbs,"" thundered below
to the atomic rockets he loved more than anything else in the universe.
Roger Manning, the third member of the famed _Polaris_ unit, raced up
the narrow ladder leading to the radar bridge to take command of
astrogation and communications.

While Captain Strong and the members of the _Arcturus_ unit strapped
themselves into acceleration cushions, Tom conducted a routine check of
the many gauges on the great control panel before him. Satisfied, he
flipped open the intercom and called, ""All stations, check in!""

""Radar deck, aye!"" drawled Roger's lazy voice.

""Power deck, aye!"" rumbled Astro.

""Energize the cooling pumps!"" ordered Tom.

""Cooling pumps, aye!""

The whine of the mighty pumps was suddenly heard, moaning eerily
throughout the ship.

""Feed reactant!""

The sharp hiss of fuel being forced into the rocket engines rose above
the whine of the pumps, and the ship trembled.

""Stand by to blast,"" called Tom. ""Standard space speed!""

Instantly the _Polaris_ shot toward Earth in a long, curving arc.
Moments later, when the huge round ball of the mother planet loomed
large on the scanner screen, Roger's voice reported over the intercom,
""Academy spaceport control gives us approach orbit 074 for touchdown on
Ramp Twelve, Tom.""

""074 Ramp Twelve,"" repeated Tom. ""Got it!""

""Twelve!"" roared Astro suddenly over the intercom. ""Couldn't you make it
closer to the Academy than that, Manning? We'll have to walk two miles
to the nearest slidewalk!""

""Too bad, Astro,"" retorted Roger, ""but I guess if I had to carry around
as much useless muscle and bone as you do, I'd complain too!""

""I'm just not as lucky as you, Manning,"" snapped Astro quickly. ""I don't
have all that space gas to float me around.""

""Knock it off, fellows,"" interjected Tom firmly. ""We're going into our
approach.""

Lying on his acceleration cushion, Strong looked over at Tony Richards
of the _Arcturus_ unit and winked. Richards winked and smiled back.
""They never stop, do they, sir?""

""When they do,"" replied Strong, ""I'll send all three of them to sick bay
for examination.""

""Two hundred thousand feet to Earth's surface,"" called Tom. ""Stand by
for landing operations.""

As Tom adjusted the many controls on the complicated operations panel of
the ship, Roger and Astro followed his orders quickly and exactly. ""Cut
main drive rockets and give me one-half thrust on forward braking
rockets!"" ordered Tom, his eyes glued to the altimeter.

The _Polaris_ shuddered under the sudden reverse in power, then began an
upward curve, nose pointing back toward space. Tom barked another
command. ""Braking rockets full! Stand by main drive rockets!""

The sleek ship began to settle tailfirst toward its destination--Space
Academy, U.S.A.

In the heart of a great expanse of cleared land in the western part of
the North American continent, the cluster of buildings that marked Space
Academy gleamed brightly in the noon sun. Towering over the green grassy
quadrangle of the Academy was the magnificent Tower of Galileo, built of
pure Titan crystal which gleamed like a gigantic diamond. With smaller
buildings, including the study halls, the nucleonics laboratory, the
cadet dormitories, mess halls, recreation halls, all connected by
rolling slidewalks--and to the north, the vast area of the spaceport
with its blast-pitted ramps--the Academy was the goal of every boy in
the year A.D. 2353, the age of the conquest of space.

Founded over a hundred years before, Space Academy trained the youth of
the Solar Alliance for service in the Solar Guard, the powerful force
created to protect the liberties of the planets. But from the beginning,
Academy standards were so high, requirements so strict, that not many
made it. Of the one thousand boys enrolled every year, it was expected
that only twenty-one of them would become officers, and of this group,
only seven would be command pilots. The great Solar Guard fleet that
patrolled the space lanes across the millions of miles between the
satellites and planets possessed the finest, yet most complicated,
equipment in the Alliance. To be an officer in the fleet required a
combination of skills and technical knowledge so demanding that eighty
per cent of the Solar Guard officers retired at the age of forty.

High over the spaceport, the three cadets of the _Polaris_ unit, happy
over the prospect of a full month of freedom, concentrated on the task
of landing the great ship on the Academy spaceport. Watching the
teleceiver screen that gave him a view of the spaceport astern of the
ship, Tom called into the intercom, ""One thousand feet to touchdown. Cut
braking rockets. Main drive full!""

The thunderous blast of the rockets was his answer, building up into
roaring violence. Shuddering, the great cruiser eased to the ground foot
by foot, perfectly balanced on the fiery exhaust from her main tubes.

Seconds later the giant shock absorbers crunched on the ramp and Tom
closed the master switch cutting all power. He glanced at the astral
chronometer over his head and then turned to speak into the audio log
recorder. ""Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ completed space flight one-seven-six
at 1301.""

Captain Strong stepped up to Tom and clapped him on the shoulder.
""Secure the _Polaris_, Tom, and tell Astro to get the reactant pile from
the firing chamber ready for dumping when the hot-soup wagon gets here.""
The Solar Guard officer referred to the lead-lined jet sled that removed
the reactant piles from all ships that were to be laid up for longer
than three days. ""And you'd better get over to your dorm right away,""
Strong continued. ""You have to get ready for parade and full Corps
dismissal.""

Tom grinned. ""Yes, sir!""

""We're blasting off, sir,"" said Tony Richards, stepping forward with his
unit mates. ""Congratulations again, Corbett. I still can't figure out
how you did it so quickly!""

""Thanks, Tony,"" replied Tom graciously. ""It was luck and the pressure of
good competition.""

Richards shook hands and then turned to Strong. ""Do I have your
permission to leave the ship, sir?"" he asked.

""Permission granted,"" replied Strong. ""And have a good leave.""

""Thank you, sir.""

The three _Arcturus_ cadets saluted and left the ship. A moment later
Roger and Astro joined Strong and Tom on the control deck.

""Well,"" said Strong, ""what nonsense have you three planned for your
leave? Try and see Liddy Tamal. I hear she's making a new stereo about
the Solar Guard. You might be hired as technical assistants."" He smiled.
The famous actress was a favorite of the cadets. Strong waited. ""Well,
is it a secret?""
",venus_revolt,rockwell,1954,1,1211
"
""It was your idea, Astro,"" said Roger. ""Go ahead.""

""Yeah,"" said Tom. ""You got us into this.""

""Well, sir,"" mumbled Astro, turning red with embarrassment, ""we're going
to Venus.""

""What's so unusual about going to Venus?"" asked Strong.

""We're going hunting,"" replied Astro.

""Hunting?""

""Yes, sir,"" gulped the big Venusian. ""For tyrannosaurus.""

Strong's jaw dropped and he sat down suddenly on the nearest
acceleration cushion. ""I expected something a little strange from you
three whiz kids."" He laughed. ""It would be impossible for you to go home
and relax for a month. But this blasts me! Hunting for a tyrannosaurus!
What are you going to do with it after you catch it?"" He paused and then
added, ""If you do.""

""Eat it,"" said Astro simply. ""Tyrannosaurus steak is delicious!""

Strong doubled with laughter at the seriousness of Astro's expression.
The giant Venusian continued doggedly, ""And besides, there's a bounty on
them. A thousand credits for every tyranno head brought in. They're
dangerous and destroy a lot of crops.""

Strong straightened up. ""All right, all right! Go ahead! Have yourselves
a good time, but don't take any unnecessary chances. I like my cadets to
have all the arms and legs and heads they're supposed to have."" He
paused and glanced at his watch. ""You'd better get hopping. Astro, did
you get the pile ready for the soup wagon?""

""Yes, sir!""

""Very well, Tom, secure the ship."" He came to attention. ""Unit,
_stand--to_!""

The three cadets stiffened and saluted sharply.

""Unit dismissed!""

Captain Strong turned and left the ship.

Hurriedly, Tom, Roger, and Astro checked the great spaceship and fifteen
minutes later were racing out of the main air lock. Hitching a ride on a
jet sled to the nearest slidewalk, they were soon being whisked along
toward their quarters. Already, cadet units were standing around in
fresh blues waiting for the call for final dress parade.

At exactly fifteen hundred, the entire Cadet Corps stepped off with
electronic precision for the final drill of the term. By threes, each
unit marching together, with the _Polaris_ unit walking behind the
standard bearers as honor unit, they passed the reviewing stand. Senior
officers of the Solar Guard, delegates from the Solar Alliance, and
staff officers of the Academy accepted their salute. Commander Walters
stood stiffly in front of the stand, his heart filled with pride as he
recognized the honor unit. He had almost washed out the _Polaris_ unit
in the beginning of their Academy training.

Major Lou Connel, Senior Line Officer of the Solar Guard, stepped
forward when the cadets came to a stop and presented Tom, Roger, and
Astro with the emblem of their achievement, a small gold pin in the
shape of a rocket ship. He, too, had had his difficulties with the
_Polaris_ unit, and while he had never been heard to compliment anyone
on anything, expecting nothing but the best all the time, he
nevertheless congratulated them heartily as he gave them their hard-won
trophy.

After several other awards had been presented, Commander Walters
addressed the Cadet Corps, concluding with ""... each of you has had a
tough year. But when you come back in four weeks, you'll think this past
term has been a picnic. And remember, wherever you go, whatever you do,
you're Space Cadets! Act like one! But above all, have a good time!
Spaceman's luck!""

A cadet stepped forward quickly, turned to face the line of cadets, and
held up his hands. He brought them down quickly and words of the Academy
song thundered from a thousand voices.

    ""_From the rocket fields of the Academy
    To the far-flung stars of outer space,
    We're Space Cadets training to be
    Ready for dangers we may face.

    Up in the sky, rocketing past,
    Higher than high, faster than fast,
    Out into space, into the sun,
    Look at her go when we give her the gun.

    We are Space Cadets, and we are proud to say
    Our fight for right will never cease.
    Like a cosmic ray, we light the way
    To interplanet peace!_""

""_Dis_-missed!"" roared Walters. Immediately the precise lines of cadets
turned into a howling mob of eager boys, everyone seemingly running in a
different direction.

""Come on,"" said Roger. ""I've got everything set! Let's get to the
station ahead of the mob.""

""But what about our gear?"" said Tom. ""We've got to get back to the
dorm.""

""I had it sent down to the station last night. I got the monorail
tickets to Atom City last week, and reserved seats on the _Venus Lark_
two weeks ago! Come on!""

""Only Roger could handle it so sweetly,"" sighed Astro. ""You know,
hotshot, sometimes I think you're useful!""

The three cadets turned and raced across the quadrangle for the nearest
slidewalk that would take them to the Academy monorail station and the
beginning of their adventure in the jungles of Venus.

""The situation may be serious and it may not, but I don't want to take
any chances.""

Commander Walters sat in his office, high up in the Tower of Galileo,
with department heads from the Academy and Solar Guard. Behind him, an
entire wall made of clear crystal offered a breath-taking view of the
Academy grounds. Before him, their faces showing their concern over a
report Walters had just read, Captain Strong, Major Connel, Dr. Joan
Dale, and Professor Sykes waited for the commanding officer of the
Academy to continue.

""As you know,"" said Walters, ""the resolution passed by the Council in
establishing the Solar Guard specifically states that it shall be the
duty of the Solar Guard to investigate and secure evidence for the Solar
Alliance Council of any acts by any person, or group of persons,
suspected of overt action against the Solar Constitution or the
Universal Bill of Rights. Now, based on the report I've just read to
you, I would like an opinion from each of you.""

""For what purpose, Commander?"" asked Joan Dale, the young and pretty
astrophysicist.

""To decide whether it would be advisable to have a full and open
investigation of this information from the Solar Guard attaché on
Venus.""

""Why waste time talking?"" snapped Professor Sykes, the chief of the
nucleonics laboratory. ""Let's investigate. That report sounds serious.""

Major Connel leveled a beady eye on the little gray-haired man.

""Professor Sykes, an investigation is serious. When it is based on a
report like this one, it is doubly serious, and needs straight and
careful thinking. We don't want to hurt innocent people.""

Sykes shifted around in his chair and glared at the burly Solar Guard
officer. ""Don't try to tell me anything about straight thinking, Connel.
I know more about the Solar Constitution and the rights of our citizens
than you'll know in ten thousand light years!""

""Yeah?"" roared Connel. ""And with all your brains you'd probably find out
these people are nothing more than a harmless bunch of colonists out on
a picnic!""

The professor shot out of his chair and waved an angry finger under
Connel's nose. ""And that would be a lot more than I'm finding out right
now with that contraption of yours!"" he shouted.

Connel's face turned red. ""So that's how you feel about my invention!""
he snapped.

""Yes, that's the way I feel about your invention!"" replied Sykes hotly.
""I know three cadets that could build that gadget in half the time it's
taken you just to figure out the theory!""

Commander Walters, Captain Strong, and Joan Dale were fighting to keep
from laughing at the hot exchange between the two veteran spacemen.

""They sound like the _Polaris_ unit,"" Joan whispered to Strong.

Walters stood up. ""Gentlemen! Please! We're here to discuss a report on
the activities of a secret organization on Venus. I will have to ask you
to keep to the subject at hand. Dr. Dale, do you have any comments on
the report?"" He turned to the young physicist who was choking off a
laugh.

""Well, Commander,"" she began, still smiling, ""the report is rather
sketchy. I would like to see more information before any real decision
is made.""

Walters turned to Strong. ""Steve?""

""I think Joan has the right idea, sir,"" he replied. ""While the report
indicates that a group of people on Venus are meeting regularly and
secretly, and wearing some silly uniform, I think we need more
information before ordering a full-scale investigation.""

""He's right, Commander,"" Connel broke in. ""You just can't walk into an
outfit and demand a look at their records, books, and membership index,
unless you're pretty sure you'll find something.""

""Send a man from here,"" Strong suggested. ""If you use anyone out of the
Venus office, he might be recognized.""

""Good idea,"" commented Sykes.

Joan nodded. ""Sounds reasonable.""

""How do you feel about it, Connel?"" asked Walters.

Connel, still furious over Sykes's comment on his spectrum recorder,
shot an angry glance at the professor. ""I think it's fine,"" he said
bluntly. ""Who're you going to send?""

Walters paused before answering. He glanced at Strong and then back at
Connel. ""What about yourself?""

""Me?""

""Why not?"" continued Walters. ""You know as much about Venus as anyone,
and you have a lot of friends there you can trust. Nose around a while,
see what you can learn, unofficially.""

""But what about my work on the spectrum recorder?"" asked Connel.

""That!"" snorted Sykes derisively. ""Huh, that can be completed any time
you want to listen to some plain facts about--""

""I'll never listen to anything you have to say, you dried-up old neutron
chaser!"" blasted Connel.

""Of course not,"" cackled Sykes. ""And it's the same bullheaded
stubbornness that'll keep you from finishing that recorder.""

""I'm sorry, gentlemen,"" said Walters firmly. ""I cannot allow personal
discussions to interfere with the problem at hand. How about it, Connel?
Will you go to Venus?""

Lou Connel was the oldest line officer in the Solar Guard, having
recommended the slightly younger Walters for the post of commandant of
Space Academy and the Solar Guard so that he himself could escape a desk
job and continue blasting through space where he had devoted his entire
life. While Walters had the authority to order him to accept the
assignment, Connel knew that if he begged off because of his work on the
recorder, Walters would understand and offer the assignment to Strong.
He paused and then growled, ""When do I blast off?""

Walters smiled and answered, ""As soon as we contact Venus headquarters
and tell them to expect you.""

""Wouldn't it be better to let me go without any fanfare?"" mused the
burly spaceman. ""I could just take a ship and act as though I'm on some
kind of special detail. As a matter of fact, Higgleston at the Venusport
lab has some information I could use.""
",venus_revolt,rockwell,1954,1,982
"
""Anything Higgleston could tell you,"" interjected Sykes, ""I can tell
you! You're just too stubborn to listen to me.""

Connel opened his mouth to blast the professor in return, but he caught
a sharp look from Walters and he clamped his lips together tightly.

""I guess that's it, then,"" said Walters. ""Anyone have any other ideas?""
He glanced around the room. ""Joan? Steve?""

Dr. Dale and Captain Strong shook their heads silently. Strong was
disappointed that he had not been given the assignment on Venus. Four
weeks at the deserted Academy would seem like living in a graveyard.
Walters sensed his feelings, and smiling, he said, ""You've been going
like a hot rocket this past year, Steve. I have a specific assignment
for you.""

""Yes, sir!"" Strong looked up eagerly.

""I want you to go to the Sweet Water Lakes around New Chicago--""

""Yes, sir?""

""--go to my cabin--""

""Sir?""

""--_and go fishing_!""

Strong grinned. ""Thanks, skipper,"" he said quietly. ""I guess I could use
a little relaxation. I was almost tempted to join Corbett, Manning, and
Astro. They're going hunting in the jungle belt of Venus for a
tyrannosaurus!""

""Blast my jets!"" roared Connel. ""Those boys haven't killed themselves in
line of duty, so they go out and tangle with the biggest and most
dangerous monster in the entire solar system!""

""Well,"" said Joan with a smile, ""I'll put my money on Astro against a
tyranno any time, pound for pound!""

""Hear, hear!"" chimed in Sykes, and forgetting his argument with Connel,
he turned to the spaceman. ""Say, Lou,"" he said, ""when you get to Venus
tell Higgy I said to show you that magnetic ionoscope he's rigging up.
It might give you some ideas.""

""Thanks,"" replied Connel, also forgetting the hot exchange of a few
minutes before. He stood up. ""I'll take the _Polaris_, Commander. She's
the fastest ship available with automatic controls for a solo hop.""

""She's been stripped of her reactant pile, Major,"" said Strong. ""It'll
take a good eighteen hours to soup her up again.""

""I'll take care of it,"" said Connel. ""Are there any specific orders,
Commander?""

""Use your own judgment, Lou,"" said Walters. ""You know what we want and
how far to go to get it. If you learn anything, we'll start a full-scale
investigation. If not, we'll forget the whole matter and no one will get
hurt.""

""And the Solar Guard won't get a reputation of being nosy,"" added
Strong.

Connel nodded. ""I'll take care of it."" He shook hands all around, coming
to Sykes last. ""Sorry I lost my temper, Professor,"" he said gruffly.

""Forget it, Major."" Sykes smiled. He really admired the gruff spaceman.

The thick-set senior officer came to smart attention, saluted crisply,
turned, and left the office. For the time being, the mysterious trouble
on Venus was his responsibility.

""Atom City express leaving on Track Four!""

A metallic voice boomed over the station loud-speaker, as last-minute
passengers boarded the long line of gleaming white monorail cars,
hanging from a single overhead steel rail. In the open doorway of one
of the end cars, a conductor lifted his arm, then paused and waited
patiently as three Space Cadets raced down the stairs and along the
platform in a headlong dash for the train. They piled inside, almost one
on top of the other.

""Thanks for waiting, sir,"" gasped Tom Corbett.

""Not at all, Cadet,"" said the conductor. ""I couldn't let you waste your
leave waiting for another train.""

The elderly man flipped a switch in the narrow vestibule and the door
closed with a soft hiss of air. He inserted a light key into a near-by
socket and twisted it gently, completing a circuit that flashed the ""go""
light in the engineer's cab. Almost immediately, the monorail train
eased forward, suspended on the overhead rail. By the time the last
building of Space Academy flashed past, the train was rolling along at
full speed on its dash across the plains to Atom City.

The ride to the great metropolis of the North American continent was
filled with excitement and anticipation for the three members of the
_Polaris_ crew. The cars were crowded with cadets on leave, and while
there was a lot of joking and horseplay, the few civilian passengers
were impressed with the gentlemanly bearing of the young spacemen. Tom
and Roger finally settled down to read the latest magazines supplied by
the monorail company. But Astro headed for the dining car where he
attracted a great deal of attention by his order of a dozen eggs,
followed by two orders of waffles and a full quart of milk. Finally,
when the dining-car steward called a halt, because it was closing time,
Astro made his way back to Tom and Roger with a plastic bag of French
fried potatoes, and the three boys sat, munching them happily. The
countryside flashed by in a blur of summer color as the train roared on
at a speed of two hundred miles an hour.

A few hours and four bags of potatoes later, Astro yawned and stretched
his enormous arms, nearly poking Roger in the eye.

""Hey, ya big ape!"" growled Roger. ""Watch the eye!""

""You'd never miss it, Manning,"" said Astro. ""Just use your radar.""

""Never mind, I like this eye just the way it is.""

""We're almost there,"" called Tom. He pointed out the crystal window and
they could see the high peaks of the Rocky Mountain range looming ahead.
""We cut through the new tunnel in those mountains and we'll be in Atom
City in ten minutes!""

There was a bustle of activity around them as other cadets roused
themselves and collected their gear. Once again conversation became
animated and excited as the train neared its destination. Flashing into
the tunnel, the line of cars began to slow down, rocking gently.

""We'd better go right out to the spaceport,"" said Tom, pulling his gear
out of the recessed rack under his seat. ""Our ship blasts off for Venus
in less than a half-hour.""

""Boy, it'll be a pleasure to ride a spaceship without having to
astrogate,"" said Roger. ""I'll just sit back and take it easy. Hope there
are some good-looking space dolls aboard.""

Tom turned to Astro. ""You know, Astro,"" he said seriously, ""it's a good
thing we're along to take care of this Romeo. If he were alone, he'd
wind up in another kind of hunt.""

""I'd like to see how Manning's tactics work on a female dasypus
novemcinctur maximus,"" said Astro with a sly grin.

""A female what?"" yelled Roger.

""A giant armadillo, Roger,"" Tom explained, laughing. ""Very big and very
mean when they don't like you. Don't forget, everything on Venus grows
big because of the lighter gravity.""

""Yeah,"" drawled Roger, looking at Astro. ""Big and dumb!""

""What was that again?"" bellowed the giant Venusian, reaching for the
flip cadet. The next moment, Roger was struggling futilely, feet kicking
wildly as Astro held him at arm's length six inches off the floor. The
cadets in the car roared with laughter.

""Atom City!"" a voice over the intercar communicator boomed and the boys
looked out the window to see the towering buildings of Atom City slowly
slide by. The train had scarcely reached a full stop when the three
cadets piled out of the door, raced up the slidestairs, and jumped into
a jet cab. Fifteen minutes later they marched up to one of the many
ticket counters of the Atom City Interplanetary Spaceport.

A SHIFTING REEF

The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and
puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.  Not to
mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the
public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were
particularly excited.  Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,
skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries,
and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were
deeply interested in the matter.

For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long
object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely
larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.

The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)
agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in
question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power
of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed.  If
it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in
science.  Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at
divers times--rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to
this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated
opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length--we
might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all
dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at
all.  And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that
tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we
can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this
supernatural apparition.  As to classing it in the list of fables, the
idea was out of the question.

On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the
Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass
five miles off the east coast of Australia.  Captain Baker thought at
first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even
prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water,
projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred
and fifty feet up into the air.  Now, unless the sandbank had been
submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor
Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal,
unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water
mixed with air and vapour.

Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in
the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam
Navigation Company.  But this extraordinary creature could transport
itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an
interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had
observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a
distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.

Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the Helvetia, of
the Compagnie-Nationale, and the Shannon, of the Royal Mail Steamship
Company, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying
between the United States and Europe, respectively signalled the
monster to each other in 42° 15' N. lat. and 60° 35' W. long.
In these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in
estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred
and fifty feet, as the Shannon and Helvetia were of smaller dimensions
than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.

Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea
round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never
exceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.

In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion.  They sang
of it in the cafes, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on
the stage.  All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it.  There
appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary
creature, from the white whale, the terrible ""Moby Dick"" of sub-arctic
regions, to the immense kraken, whose tentacles could entangle a ship
of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean.  The
legends of ancient times were even revived.

Then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the
unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals.
""The question of the monster"" inflamed all minds.  Editors of
scientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,
spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing
blood; for from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.

During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried,
never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public.  It was
then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger
seriously to be avoided.  The question took quite another shape.  The
monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite
and shifting proportions.

On the 5th of March, 1867, the Moravian, of the Montreal Ocean Company,
finding herself during the night in 27° 30' lat. and 72° 15'
long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for
that part of the sea.  Under the combined efforts of the wind and its
four hundred horse power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.
Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the Moravian,
she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the 237
passengers she was bringing home from Canada.

The accident happened about five o'clock in the morning, as the day was
breaking.  The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part
of the vessel.  They examined the sea with the most careful attention.
They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables' length distant,
as if the surface had been violently agitated.  The bearings of the
place were taken exactly, and the Moravian continued its route without
apparent damage.  Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous
wreck?  They could not tell; but, on examination of the ship's bottom
when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of her keel was broken.

This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like
many others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under
similar circumstances.  But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of
the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel
belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.

The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze
favourable, the Scotia, of the Cunard Company's line, found herself in
15° 12' long. and 45° 37' lat.  She was going at the speed of
thirteen knots and a half.
",20000leagues,verne,1870,1,1146
"
At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers
were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on
the hull of the Scotia, on her quarter, a little aft of the port-paddle.

The Scotia had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by
something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt.  The shock had been
so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts
of the carpenter's watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, ""We
are sinking! we are sinking!""  At first the passengers were much
frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them.  The danger
could not be imminent.  The Scotia, divided into seven compartments by
strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak.  Captain
Anderson went down immediately into the hold.  He found that the sea
was pouring into the fifth compartment; and the rapidity of the influx
proved that the force of the water was considerable.  Fortunately this
compartment did not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been
immediately extinguished.  Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be
stopped at once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent
of the injury.  Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence
of a large hole, two yards in diameter, in the ship's bottom.  Such a
leak could not be stopped; and the Scotia, her paddles half submerged,
was obliged to continue her course.  She was then three hundred miles
from Cape Clear, and, after three days' delay, which caused great
uneasiness in Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.

The engineers visited the Scotia, which was put in dry dock.  They
could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below
water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.
The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it
could not have been more neatly done by a punch.  It was clear, then,
that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp
and, after having been driven with prodigious strength, and piercing an
iron plate 1 3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a backward
motion.

Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the
torrent of public opinion.  From this moment all unlucky casualties
which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster.

Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these
shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three
thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd's, the number
of sailing and steam-ships supposed to be totally lost, from the
absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!

Now, it was the ""monster"" who, justly or unjustly, was accused of their
disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the different
continents became more and more dangerous.  The public demanded sharply
that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable
cetacean.[1]

PRO AND CON

At the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a
scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the
United States.  In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the
Museum of Natural History in Paris, the French Government had attached
me to that expedition.  After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New
York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection.  My
departure for France was fixed for the first days in May.  Meanwhile I
was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and
zoological riches, when the accident happened to the Scotia.

I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day.
How could I be otherwise?  I had read and reread all the American and
European papers without being any nearer a conclusion.  This mystery
puzzled me.  Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped
from one extreme to the other.  That there really was something could
not be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on
the wound of the Scotia.

On my arrival at New York the question was at its height.  The theory
of the floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank, supported by
minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.  And, indeed,
unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its
position with such astonishing rapidity?

From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck
was given up.

There remained, then, only two possible solutions of the question,
which created two distinct parties:  on one side, those who were for a
monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a
submarine vessel of enormous motive power.

But this last theory, plausible as it was, could not stand against
inquiries made in both worlds.  That a private gentleman should have
such a machine at his command was not likely.  Where, when, and how was
it built? and how could its construction have been kept secret?
Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine.  And
in these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the
power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of
others, a State might try to work such a formidable engine.

But the idea of a war machine fell before the declaration of
Governments.  As public interest was in question, and transatlantic
communications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted.  But how
admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the
public eye?  For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such
circumstances would be very difficult, and for a State whose every act
is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible.

Upon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour of
consulting me on the phenomenon in question.  I had published in France
a work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled Mysteries of the Great
Submarine Grounds.  This book, highly approved of in the learned world,
gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of
Natural History.  My advice was asked.  As long as I could deny the
reality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative.  But
soon, finding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain
myself point by point.  I discussed the question in all its forms,
politically and scientifically; and I give here an extract from a
carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the 30th
of April.  It ran as follows:

""After examining one by one the different theories, rejecting all other
suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine
animal of enormous power.

""The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us.  Soundings
cannot reach them.  What passes in those remote depths--what beings
live, or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the
waters--what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely
conjecture.  However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may
modify the form of the dilemma.  Either we do know all the varieties of
beings which people our planet, or we do not.  If we do NOT know them
all--if Nature has still secrets in the deeps for us, nothing is more
conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or
cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation
formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an
accident of some sort has brought at long intervals to the upper level
of the ocean.
",20000leagues,verne,1870,1,1282
"
""If, on the contrary, we DO know all living kinds, we must necessarily
seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already
classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the existence
of a gigantic narwhal.

""The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea, often attains a length of
sixty feet.  Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strength
proportionate to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you
obtain the animal required.  It will have the proportions determined by
the officers of the Shannon, the instrument required by the perforation
of the Scotia, and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the
steamer.

""Indeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd,
according to the expression of certain naturalists.  The principal tusk
has the hardness of steel.  Some of these tusks have been found buried
in the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success.
Others have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of
ships, which they had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces
a barrel.  The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one
of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and
fifteen inches in diameter at the base.

""Very well! suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal
ten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,
and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required.
Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a
sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but with
a real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the `rams' of war, whose
massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time.  Thus
may this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something
over and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or
experienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility.""

These last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,
I wished to shelter my dignity as professor, and not give too much
cause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.
I reserved for myself a way of escape.  In effect, however, I admitted
the existence of the ""monster."" My article was warmly discussed, which
procured it a high reputation.  It rallied round it a certain number of
partisans.  The solution it proposed gave, at least, full liberty to
the imagination.  The human mind delights in grand conceptions of
supernatural beings.  And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the
only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial
animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be
produced or developed.

The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from
this point of view.  The Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's
List, the Packet-Boat, and the Maritime and Colonial Review, all papers
devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of
premium, were unanimous on this point.  Public opinion had been
pronounced.  The United States were the first in the field; and in New
York they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this
narwhal.  A frigate of great speed, the Abraham Lincoln, was put in
commission as soon as possible.  The arsenals were opened to Commander
Farragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate; but, as it always
happens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monster
did not appear.  For two months no one heard it spoken of.  No ship met
with it.  It seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around
it.  It had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable,
that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on
its passage and was making the most of it.

So when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign, and provided
with formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course to
pursue.  Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they learned
that a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to
Shanghai, had seen the animal three weeks before in the North Pacific
Ocean.  The excitement caused by this news was extreme.  The ship was
revictualled and well stocked with coal.

Three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left Brooklyn pier, I received a
letter worded as follows:

To M. ARONNAX, Professor in the Museum of Paris, Fifth Avenue Hotel,
New York.

SIR,--If you will consent to join the Abraham Lincoln in this
expedition, the Government of the United States will with pleasure see
France represented in the enterprise.  Commander Farragut has a cabin
at your disposal.

Very cordially yours, J.B. HOBSON, Secretary of Marine.


I FORM MY RESOLUTION

Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson's letter I no more
thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the
North Sea.  Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable
Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my
life, was to chase this disturbing monster and purge it from the world.

But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for
repose.  I aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country, my
friends, my little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes, my dear and
precious collections--but nothing could keep me back!  I forgot
all--fatigue, friends and collections--and accepted without hesitation
the offer of the American Government.

""Besides,"" thought I, ""all roads lead back to Europe; and the unicorn
may be amiable enough to hurry me towards the coast of France.  This
worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of Europe (for
my particular benefit), and I will not bring back less than half a yard
of his ivory halberd to the Museum of Natural History."" But in the
meanwhile I must seek this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which,
to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes.
",20000leagues,verne,1870,1,1016
"
""Conseil,"" I called in an impatient voice.

Conseil was my servant, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had
accompanied me in all my travels.  I liked him, and he returned the
liking well.  He was quiet by nature, regular from principle, zealous
from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of
life, very quick with his hands, and apt at any service required of
him; and, despite his name, never giving advice--even when asked for it.

Conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led.
Never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never
make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might
be, or however far away, whether China or Congo.  Besides all this, he
had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no
nerves; good morals are understood.  This boy was thirty years old, and
his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty.  May I be excused
for saying that I was forty years old?

But Conseil had one fault:  he was ceremonious to a degree, and would
never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes
provoking.

""Conseil,"" said I again, beginning with feverish hands to make
preparations for my departure.

Certainly I was sure of this devoted boy.  As a rule, I never asked him
if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels; but
this time the expedition in question might be prolonged, and the
enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of
sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell.  Here there was matter for
reflection even to the most impassive man in the world.  What would
Conseil say?

""Conseil,"" I called a third time.

Conseil appeared.

""Did you call, sir?"" said he, entering.

""Yes, my boy; make preparations for me and yourself too.  We leave in
two hours.""

""As you please, sir,"" replied Conseil, quietly.

""Not an instant to lose; lock in my trunk all travelling utensils,
coats, shirts, and stockings--without counting, as many as you can, and
make haste.""

""And your collections, sir?"" observed Conseil.

""They will keep them at the hotel.""

""We are not returning to Paris, then?"" said Conseil.

""Oh! certainly,"" I answered, evasively, ""by making a curve.""

""Will the curve please you, sir?""

""Oh! it will be nothing; not quite so direct a road, that is all.  We
take our passage in the Abraham, Lincoln.""

""As you think proper, sir,"" coolly replied Conseil.

""You see, my friend, it has to do with the monster--the famous narwhal.
We are going to purge it from the seas.  A glorious mission, but a
dangerous one!  We cannot tell where we may go; these animals can be
very capricious.  But we will go whether or no; we have got a captain
who is pretty wide-awake.""

Our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately.  I
hastened on board and asked for Commander Farragut.  One of the sailors
conducted me to the poop, where I found myself in the presence of a
good-looking officer, who held out his hand to me.

""Monsieur Pierre Aronnax?"" said he.

""Himself,"" replied I. ""Commander Farragut?""

""You are welcome, Professor; your cabin is ready for you.""

I bowed, and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me.

The Abraham Lincoln had been well chosen and equipped for her new
destination.  She was a frigate of great speed, fitted with
high-pressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres.
Under this the Abraham Lincoln attained the mean speed of nearly
eighteen knots and a third an hour--a considerable speed, but,
nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean.

The interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical
qualities.  I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was in the after
part, opening upon the gunroom.

""We shall be well off here,"" said I to Conseil.

""As well, by your honour's leave, as a hermit-crab in the shell of a
whelk,"" said Conseil.

I left Conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away, and remounted the
poop in order to survey the preparations for departure.

At that moment Commander Farragut was ordering the last moorings to be
cast loose which held the Abraham Lincoln to the pier of Brooklyn.  So
in a quarter of an hour, perhaps less, the frigate would have sailed
without me.  I should have missed this extraordinary, supernatural, and
incredible expedition, the recital of which may well meet with some
suspicion.

But Commander Farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the
seas in which the animal had been sighted.  He sent for the engineer.

""Is the steam full on?"" asked he.

""Yes, sir,"" replied the engineer.

""Go ahead,"" cried Commander Farragut.
",20000leagues,verne,1870,1,801
"


NED LAND

Captain Farragut was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he commanded.
His vessel and he were one.  He was the soul of it.  On the question of
the monster there was no doubt in his mind, and he would not allow the
existence of the animal to be disputed on board.  He believed in it, as
certain good women believe in the leviathan--by faith, not by reason.
The monster did exist, and he had sworn to rid the seas of it.  Either
Captain Farragut would kill the narwhal, or the narwhal would kill the
captain.  There was no third course.

The officers on board shared the opinion of their chief.  They were
ever chatting, discussing, and calculating the various chances of a
meeting, watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean.  More than
one took up his quarters voluntarily in the cross-trees, who would have
cursed such a berth under any other circumstances.  As long as the sun
described its daily course, the rigging was crowded with sailors, whose
feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render
it unbearable; still the Abraham Lincoln had not yet breasted the
suspected waters of the Pacific.  As to the ship's company, they
desired nothing better than to meet the unicorn, to harpoon it, hoist
it on board, and despatch it.  They watched the sea with eager
attention.

Besides, Captain Farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand
dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he
cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer.

I leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the Abraham Lincoln.

For my own part I was not behind the others, and, left to no one my
share of daily observations.  The frigate might have been called the
Argus, for a hundred reasons.  Only one amongst us, Conseil, seemed to
protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us
all, and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on
board.

I have said that Captain Farragut had carefully provided his ship with
every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean.  No whaler had ever
been better armed.  We possessed every known engine, from the harpoon
thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss, and the
explosive balls of the duck-gun.  On the forecastle lay the perfection
of a breech-loading gun, very thick at the breech, and very narrow in
the bore, the model of which had been in the Exhibition of 1867.  This
precious weapon of American origin could throw with ease a conical
projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles.

Thus the Abraham Lincoln wanted for no means of destruction; and, what
was better still she had on board Ned Land, the prince of harpooners.

Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who
knew no equal in his dangerous occupation.  Skill, coolness, audacity,
and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a cunning
whale to escape the stroke of his harpoon.

Ned Land was about forty years of age; he was a tall man (more than six
feet high), strongly built, grave and taciturn, occasionally violent,
and very passionate when contradicted.  His person attracted attention,
but above all the boldness of his look, which gave a singular
expression to his face.

Who calls himself Canadian calls himself French; and, little
communicative as Ned Land was, I must admit that he took a certain
liking for me.  My nationality drew him to me, no doubt.  It was an
opportunity for him to talk, and for me to hear, that old language of
Rabelais, which is still in use in some Canadian provinces.  The
harpooner's family was originally from Quebec, and was already a tribe
of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to France.

Little by little, Ned Land acquired a taste for chatting, and I loved
to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas.  He related
his fishing, and his combats, with natural poetry of expression; his
recital took the form of an epic poem, and I seemed to be listening to
a Canadian Homer singing the Iliad of the regions of the North.

I am portraying this hardy companion as I really knew him.  We are old
friends now, united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and
cemented amidst extreme dangers.  Ah, brave Ned!  I ask no more than to
live a hundred years longer, that I may have more time to dwell the
longer on your memory.

Now, what was Ned Land's opinion upon the question of the marine
monster?  I must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn, and was
the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction.  He
even avoided the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press
upon him.  One magnificent evening, the 30th July (that is to say,
three weeks after our departure), the frigate was abreast of Cape
Blanc, thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia.  We had
crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and the Straits of Magellan opened
less than seven hundred miles to the south.  Before eight days were
over the Abraham Lincoln would be ploughing the waters of the Pacific.

Seated on the poop, Ned Land and I were chatting of one thing and
another as we looked at this mysterious sea, whose great depths had up
to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man.  I naturally led up
the conversation to the giant unicorn, and examined the various chances
of success or failure of the expedition.  But, seeing that Ned Land let
me speak without saying too much himself, I pressed him more closely.

""Well, Ned,"" said I, ""is it possible that you are not convinced of the
existence of this cetacean that we are following?  Have you any
particular reason for being so incredulous?""

The harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering,
struck his broad forehead with his hand (a habit of his), as if to
collect himself, and said at last, ""Perhaps I have, Mr. Aronnax.""

""But, Ned, you, a whaler by profession, familiarised with all the great
marine mammalia--YOU ought to be the last to doubt under such
circumstances!""

""That is just what deceives you, Professor,"" replied Ned.  ""As a whaler
I have followed many a cetacean, harpooned a great number, and killed
several; but, however strong or well-armed they may have been, neither
their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the
iron plates of a steamer.""

""But, Ned, they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have
pierced through and through.""

""Wooden ships--that is possible,"" replied the Canadian, ""but I have
never seen it done; and, until further proof, I deny that whales,
cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe.""

""Well, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of
facts.  I believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised,
belonging to the branch of vertebrata, like the whales, the cachalots,
or the dolphins, and furnished with a horn of defence of great
penetrating power.""

""Hum!"" said the harpooner, shaking his head with the air of a man who
would not be convinced.

""Notice one thing, my worthy Canadian,"" I resumed.  ""If such an animal
is in existence, if it inhabits the depths of the ocean, if it
frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, it
must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would
defy all comparison.""

""And why this powerful organisation?"" demanded Ned.
",20000leagues,verne,1870,1,1288
"
""Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one's self in these
strata and resist their pressure.  Listen to me.  Let us admit that the
pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of
water thirty-two feet high.  In reality the column of water would be
shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is
greater than that of fresh water.  Very well, when you dive, Ned, as
many times 32 feet of water as there are above you, so many times does
your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is to
say, 15 lb. for each square inch of its surface.  It follows, then,
that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres, of 100
atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and of 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet,
that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if you could
attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an inch of
the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5,600 lb.  Ah! my
brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface
of your body?""

""I have no idea, Mr. Aronnax.""

""About 6,500; and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15
lb.  to the square inch, your 6,500 square inches bear at this moment a
pressure of 97,500 lb.""

""Without my perceiving it?""

""Without your perceiving it.  And if you are not crushed by such a
pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body
with equal pressure.  Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior
and exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which
allows you to bear it without inconvenience.  But in the water it is
another thing.""

""Yes, I understand,"" replied Ned, becoming more attentive; ""because the
water surrounds me, but does not penetrate.""

""Precisely, Ned:  so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you
would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lb.; at 320 feet, ten times that
pressure; at 3,200 feet, a hundred times that pressure; lastly, at
32,000 feet, a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000
lb.--that is to say, that you would be flattened as if you had been
drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!""

""The devil!"" exclaimed Ned.

""Very well, my worthy harpooner, if some vertebrate, several hundred
yards long, and large in proportion, can maintain itself in such
depths--of those whose surface is represented by millions of square
inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the
pressure they undergo.  Consider, then, what must be the resistance of
their bony structure, and the strength of their organisation to
withstand such pressure!""

""Why!"" exclaimed Ned Land, ""they must be made of iron plates eight
inches thick, like the armoured frigates.""

""As you say, Ned.  And think what destruction such a mass would cause,
if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a
vessel.""

""Yes--certainly--perhaps,"" replied the Canadian, shaken by these
figures, but not yet willing to give in.

""Well, have I convinced you?""

""You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is that, if such
animals do exist at the bottom of the seas, they must necessarily be as
strong as you say.""

""But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the
accident to the Scotia?""



AT A VENTURE

The voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was for a long time marked by no
special incident.  But one circumstance happened which showed the
wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might
place in him.

The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we
learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal.  But one of them, the
captain of the Monroe, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the
Abraham Lincoln, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in
sight.  Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave
him permission to go on board the Monroe.  And fate served our Canadian
so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double
blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other after
some minutes' pursuit.

Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land's harpoon, I
would not bet in its favour.

The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great
rapidity.  The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of
Magellan, level with Cape Vierges.  But Commander Farragut would not
take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.

The ship's crew agreed with him.  And certainly it was possible that
they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass.  Many of the sailors
affirmed that the monster could not pass there, ""that he was too big
for that!""

The 6th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the Abraham
Lincoln, at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,
this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which
some Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn.  The
course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of
the frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.

""Keep your eyes open!"" called out the sailors.

And they were opened widely.  Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,
it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an
instant's repose.

I myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least attentive on
board.  Giving but few minutes to my meals, but a few hours to sleep,
indifferent to either rain or sunshine, I did not leave the poop of the
vessel.  Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the
taffrail, I devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the
sea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have I shared the
emotion of the majority of the crew, when some capricious whale raised
its black back above the waves!  The poop of the vessel was crowded on
a moment.  The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers,
each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the
cetacean.  I looked and looked till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil
kept repeating in a calm voice:

""If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!""

But vain excitement!  The Abraham Lincoln checked its speed and made
for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which
soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse.

But the weather was good.  The voyage was being accomplished under the
most favourable auspices.  It was then the bad season in Australia, the
July of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe, but the sea
was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.

"
THE GUN CLUB.


During the Federal war in the United States a new and very influential
club was established in the city of Baltimore, Maryland. It is well
known with what energy the military instinct was developed amongst that
nation of shipowners, shopkeepers, and mechanics. Mere tradesmen jumped
their counters to become extempore captains, colonels, and generals
without having passed the Military School at West Point; they soon
rivalled their colleagues of the old continent, and, like them, gained
victories by dint of lavishing bullets, millions, and men.

But where Americans singularly surpassed Europeans was in the science of
ballistics, or of throwing massive weapons by the use of an engine; not
that their arms attained a higher degree of perfection, but they were of
unusual dimensions, and consequently of hitherto unknown ranges. The
English, French, and Prussians have nothing to learn about flank,
running, enfilading, or point-blank firing; but their cannon, howitzers,
and mortars are mere pocket-pistols compared with the formidable engines
of American artillery.

This fact ought to astonish no one. The Yankees, the first mechanicians
in the world, are born engineers, just as Italians are musicians and
Germans metaphysicians. Thence nothing more natural than to see them
bring their audacious ingenuity to bear on the science of ballistics.
Hence those gigantic cannon, much less useful than sewing-machines, but
quite as astonishing, and much more admired. The marvels of this style
by Parrott, Dahlgren, and Rodman are well known. There was nothing left
the Armstrongs, Pallisers, and Treuille de Beaulieux but to bow before
their transatlantic rivals.

Therefore during the terrible struggle between Northerners and
Southerners, artillerymen were in great request; the Union newspapers
published their inventions with enthusiasm, and there was no little
tradesman nor _naïf_ ""booby"" who did not bother his head day and night
with calculations about impossible trajectory engines.

Now when an American has an idea he seeks another American to share it.
If they are three, they elect a president and two secretaries. Given
four, they elect a clerk, and a company is established. Five convoke a
general meeting, and the club is formed. It thus happened at Baltimore.
The first man who invented a new cannon took into partnership the first
man who cast it and the first man that bored it. Such was the nucleus of
the Gun Club. One month after its formation it numbered eighteen hundred
and thirty-three effective members, and thirty thousand five hundred and
seventy-five corresponding members.

One condition was imposed as a _sine quâ non_ upon every one who wished
to become a member--that of having invented, or at least perfected, a
cannon; or, in default of a cannon, a firearm of some sort. But, to tell
the truth, mere inventors of fifteen-barrelled rifles, revolvers, or
sword-pistols did not enjoy much consideration. Artillerymen were always
preferred to them in every circumstance.

""The estimation in which they are held,"" said one day a learned orator
of the Gun Club, ""is in proportion to the size of their cannon, and in
direct ratio to the square of distance attained by their projectiles!""

A little more and it would have been Newton's law of gravitation applied
to moral order.

Once the Gun Club founded, it can be easily imagined its effect upon the
inventive genius of the Americans. War-engines took colossal
proportions, and projectiles launched beyond permitted distances cut
inoffensive pedestrians to pieces. All these inventions left the timid
instruments of European artillery far behind them. This may be estimated
by the following figures:--

Formerly, ""in the good old times,"" a thirty-six pounder, at a distance
of three hundred feet, would cut up thirty-six horses, attacked in
flank, and sixty-eight men. The art was then in its infancy.
Projectiles have since made their way. The Rodman gun that sent a
projectile weighing half a ton a distance of seven miles could easily
have cut up a hundred and fifty horses and three hundred men. There was
some talk at the Gun Club of making a solemn experiment with it. But if
the horses consented to play their part, the men unfortunately were
wanting.
",moon_journey,verne,1865,1,684
"
However that may be, the effect of these cannon was very deadly, and at
each discharge the combatants fell like ears before a scythe. After such
projectiles what signified the famous ball which, at Coutras, in 1587,
disabled twenty-five men; and the one which, at Zorndorff, in 1758,
killed forty fantassins; and in 1742, Kesseldorf's Austrian cannon, of
which every shot levelled seventy enemies with the ground? What was the
astonishing firing at Jena or Austerlitz, which decided the fate of the
battle? During the Federal war much more wonderful things had been seen.
At the battle of Gettysburg, a conical projectile thrown by a
rifle-barrel cut up a hundred and seventy-three Confederates, and at the
passage of the Potomac a Rodman ball sent two hundred and fifteen
Southerners into an evidently better world. A formidable mortar must
also be mentioned, invented by J.T. Maston, a distinguished member and
perpetual secretary of the Gun Club, the result of which was far more
deadly, seeing that, at its trial shot, it killed three hundred and
thirty-seven persons--by bursting, it is true.

What can be added to these figures, so eloquent in themselves? Nothing.
So the following calculation obtained by the statistician Pitcairn will
be admitted without contestation: by dividing the number of victims
fallen under the projectiles by that of the members of the Gun Club, he
found that each one of them had killed, on his own account, an average
of two thousand three hundred and seventy-five men and a fraction.

By considering such a result it will be seen that the single
preoccupation of this learned society was the destruction of humanity
philanthropically, and the perfecting of firearms considered as
instruments of civilisation. It was a company of Exterminating Angels,
at bottom the best fellows in the world.

It must be added that these Yankees, brave as they have ever proved
themselves, did not confine themselves to formulae, but sacrificed
themselves to their theories. Amongst them might be counted officers of
every rank, those who had just made their _début_ in the profession of
arms, and those who had grown old on their gun-carriage. Many whose
names figured in the book of honour of the Gun Club remained on the
field of battle, and of those who came back the greater part bore marks
of their indisputable valour. Crutches, wooden legs, articulated arms,
hands with hooks, gutta-percha jaws, silver craniums, platinum noses,
nothing was wanting to the collection; and the above-mentioned Pitcairn
likewise calculated that in the Gun Club there was not quite one arm
amongst every four persons, and only two legs amongst six.

But these valiant artillerymen paid little heed to such small matters,
and felt justly proud when the report of a battle stated the number of
victims at tenfold the quantity of projectiles expended.

One day, however, a sad and lamentable day, peace was signed by the
survivors of the war, the noise of firing gradually ceased, the mortars
were silent, the howitzers were muzzled for long enough, and the cannon,
with muzzles depressed, were stored in the arsenals, the shots were
piled up in the parks, the bloody reminiscences were effaced, cotton
shrubs grew magnificently on the well-manured fields, mourning garments
began to be worn-out, as well as sorrow, and the Gun Club had nothing
whatever to do.

Certain old hands, inveterate workers, still went on with their
calculations in ballistics; they still imagined gigantic bombs and
unparalleled howitzers. But what was the use of vain theories that could
not be put in practice? So the saloons were deserted, the servants slept
in the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the tables, from dark
corners issued sad snores, and the members of the Gun Club, formerly so
noisy, now reduced to silence by the disastrous peace, slept the sleep
of Platonic artillery!

""This is distressing,"" said brave Tom Hunter, whilst his wooden legs
were carbonising at the fireplace of the smoking-room. ""Nothing to do!
Nothing to look forward to! What a tiresome existence! Where is the time
when cannon awoke you every morning with its joyful reports?""

""That time is over,"" answered dandy Bilsby, trying to stretch the arms
he had lost. ""There was some fun then! You invented an howitzer, and it
was hardly cast before you ran to try it on the enemy; then you went
back to the camp with an encouragement from Sherman, or a shake of the
hands from MacClellan! But now the generals have gone back to their
counters, and instead of cannon-balls they expedite inoffensive cotton
bales! Ah, by Saint Barb! the future of artillery is lost to America!""

""Yes, Bilsby,"" cried Colonel Blomsberry, ""it is too bad! One fine
morning you leave your tranquil occupations, you are drilled in the use
of arms, you leave Baltimore for the battle-field, you conduct yourself
like a hero, and in two years, three years at the latest, you are
obliged to leave the fruit of so many fatigues, to go to sleep in
deplorable idleness, and keep your hands in your pockets.""

The valiant colonel would have found it very difficult to give such a
proof of his want of occupation, though it was not the pockets that were
wanting.

""And no war in prospect, then,"" said the famous J.T. Maston, scratching
his gutta-percha cranium with his steel hook; ""there is not a cloud on
the horizon now that there is so much to do in the science of artillery!
I myself finished this very morning a diagram with plan, basin, and
elevation of a mortar destined to change the laws of warfare!""
",moon_journey,verne,1865,1,934
"
""Indeed!"" replied Tom Hunter, thinking involuntarily of the Honourable
J.T. Maston's last essay.

""Indeed!"" answered Maston. ""But what is the use of the good results of
such studies and so many difficulties conquered? It is mere waste of
time. The people of the New World seem determined to live in peace, and
our bellicose _Tribune_ has gone as far as to predict approaching
catastrophes due to the scandalous increase of population!""

""Yet, Maston,"" said Colonel Blomsberry, ""they are always fighting in
Europe to maintain the principle of nationalities!""

""What of that?""

""Why, there might be something to do over there, and if they accepted
our services--""

""What are you thinking of?"" cried Bilsby. ""Work at ballistics for the
benefit of foreigners!""

""Perhaps that would be better than not doing it at all,"" answered the
colonel.

""Doubtless,"" said J.T. Maston, ""it would be better, but such an
expedient cannot be thought of.""

""Why so?"" asked the colonel.

""Because their ideas of advancement would be contrary to all our
American customs. Those folks seem to think that you cannot be a
general-in-chief without having served as second lieutenant, which comes
to the same as saying that no one can point a gun that has not cast one.
Now that is simply--""

""Absurd!"" replied Tom Hunter, whittling the arms of his chair with his
bowie-knife; ""and as things are so, there is nothing left for us but to
plant tobacco or distil whale-oil!""

""What!"" shouted J.T. Maston, ""shall we not employ these last years of
our existence in perfecting firearms? Will not a fresh opportunity
present itself to try the ranges of our projectiles? Will the atmosphere
be no longer illuminated by the lightning of our cannons? Won't some
international difficulty crop up that will allow us to declare war
against some transatlantic power? Won't France run down one of our
steamers, or won't England, in defiance of the rights of nations, hang
up three or four of our countrymen?""

""No, Maston,"" answered Colonel Blomsberry; ""no such luck! No, not one of
those incidents will happen; and if one did, it would be of no use to
us. American sensitiveness is declining daily, and we are going to the
dogs!""

""Yes, we are growing quite humble,"" replied Bilsby.

""And we are humiliated!"" answered Tom Hunter.

""All that is only too true,"" replied J.T. Maston, with fresh vehemence.
""There are a thousand reasons for fighting floating about, and still we
don't fight! We economise legs and arms, and that to the profit of folks
that don't know what to do with them. Look here, without looking any
farther for a motive for war, did not North America formerly belong to
the English?""

""Doubtless,"" answered Tom Hunter, angrily poking the fire with the end
of his crutch.

""Well,"" replied J.T. Maston, ""why should not England in its turn belong
to the Americans?""

""It would be but justice,"" answered Colonel Blomsberry.

""Go and propose that to the President of the United States,"" cried J.T.
Maston, ""and see what sort of a reception you would get.""

""It would not be a bad reception,"" murmured Bilsby between the four
teeth he had saved from battle.

""I'faith,"" cried J.T. Maston, ""they need not count upon my vote in the
next elections.""

""Nor upon ours,"" answered with common accord these bellicose invalids.

""In the meantime,"" continued J.T. Maston, ""and to conclude, if they do
not furnish me with the opportunity of trying my new mortar on a real
battle-field, I shall send in my resignation as member of the Gun Club,
and I shall go and bury myself in the backwoods of Arkansas.""

""We will follow you there,"" answered the interlocutors of the
enterprising J.T. Maston.

Things had come to that pass, and the club, getting more excited, was
menaced with approaching dissolution, when an unexpected event came to
prevent so regrettable a catastrophe.

The very day after the foregoing conversation each member of the club
received a circular couched in these terms:--

""Baltimore, October 3rd.

""The president of the Gun Club has the honour to inform his colleagues
that at the meeting on the 5th ultimo he will make them a communication
of an extremely interesting nature. He therefore begs that they, to the
suspension of all other business, will attend, in accordance with the
present invitation,

""Their devoted colleague,

""IMPEY BARBICANE, P.G.C.""



",moon_journey,verne,1865,1,724
"
PRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION.


On the 5th of October, at 8 p.m., a dense crowd pressed into the saloons
of the Gun Club, 21, Union-square. All the members of the club residing
at Baltimore had gone on the invitation of their president. The express
brought corresponding members by hundreds, and if the meeting-hall had
not been so large, the crowd of _savants_ could not have found room in
it; they overflowed into the neighbouring rooms, down the passages, and
even into the courtyards; there they ran against the populace who were
pressing against the doors, each trying to get into the front rank, all
eager to learn the important communication of President Barbicane, all
pressing, squeezing, crushing with that liberty of action peculiar to
the masses brought up in the idea of self-government.

That evening any stranger who might have chanced to be in Baltimore
could not have obtained a place at any price in the large hall; it was
exclusively reserved to residing or corresponding members; no one else
was admitted; and the city magnates, common councillors, and select men
were compelled to mingle with their inferiors in order to catch stray
news from the interior.

The immense hall presented a curious spectacle; it was marvellously
adapted to the purpose for which it was built. Lofty pillars formed of
cannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a base, supported the fine
ironwork of the arches--real cast-iron lacework.

Trophies of blunderbusses, matchlocks, arquebuses, carbines, all sorts
of ancient or modern firearms, were picturesquely enlaced against the
walls. The gas, in full flame, came out of a thousand revolvers grouped
in the form of lustres, whilst candlesticks of pistols, and candelabra
made of guns done up in sheaves, completed this display of light. Models
of cannons, specimens of bronze, targets spotted with shot-marks,
plaques broken by the shock of the Gun Club, balls, assortments of
rammers and sponges, chaplets of shells, necklaces of projectiles,
garlands of howitzers--in a word, all the tools of the artilleryman
surprised the eyes by their wonderful arrangement, and induced a belief
that their real purpose was more ornamental than deadly.

In the place of honour was seen, covered by a splendid glass case, a
piece of breech, broken and twisted under the effort of the powder--a
precious fragment of J.T. Maston's cannon.

At the extremity of the hall the president, assisted by four
secretaries, occupied a wide platform. His chair, placed on a carved
gun-carriage, was modelled upon the powerful proportions of a 32-inch
mortar; it was pointed at an angle of 90 degs., and hung upon trunnions
so that the president could use it as a rocking-chair, very agreeable in
great heat. Upon the desk, a huge iron plate, supported upon six
carronades, stood a very tasteful inkstand, made of a beautifully-chased
Spanish piece, and a report-bell, which, when required, went off like a
revolver. During the vehement discussions this new sort of bell scarcely
sufficed to cover the voices of this legion of excited artillerymen.

In front of the desk, benches, arranged in zigzags, like the
circumvallations of intrenchment, formed a succession of bastions and
curtains where the members of the Gun Club took their seats; and that
evening, it may be said, there were plenty on the ramparts. The
president was sufficiently known for all to be assured that he would not
have called together his colleagues without a very great motive.

Impey Barbicane was a man of forty, calm, cold, austere, of a singularly
serious and concentrated mind, as exact as a chronometer, of an
imperturbable temperament and immovable character; not very chivalrous,
yet adventurous, and always bringing practical ideas to bear on the
wildest enterprises; an essential New-Englander, a Northern colonist,
the descendant of those Roundheads so fatal to the Stuarts, and the
implacable enemy of the Southern gentlemen, the ancient cavaliers of the
mother country--in a word, a Yankee cast in a single mould.

Barbicane had made a great fortune as a timber-merchant; named director
of artillery during the war, he showed himself fertile in inventions;
enterprising in his ideas, he contributed powerfully to the progress of
ballistics, gave an immense impetus to experimental researches.

He was a person of average height, having, by a rare exception in the
Gun Club, all his limbs intact. His strongly-marked features seemed to
be drawn by square and rule, and if it be true that in order to guess
the instincts of a man one must look at his profile, Barbicane seen
thus offered the most certain indications of energy, audacity, and
_sang-froid_.

At that moment he remained motionless in his chair, mute, absorbed, with
an inward look sheltered under his tall hat, a cylinder of black silk,
which seems screwed down upon the skull of American men.

His colleagues talked noisily around him without disturbing him; they
questioned one another, launched into the field of suppositions,
examined their president, and tried, but in vain, to make out the _x_ of
his imperturbable physiognomy.

Just as eight o'clock struck from the fulminating clock of the large
hall, Barbicane, as if moved by a spring, jumped up; a general silence
ensued, and the orator, in a slightly emphatic tone, spoke as follows:--

""Brave colleagues,--It is some time since an unfruitful peace plunged
the members of the Gun Club into deplorable inactivity. After a period
of some years, so full of incidents, we have been obliged to abandon our
works and stop short on the road of progress. I do not fear to proclaim
aloud that any war which would put arms in our hands again would be
welcome--""

""Yes, war!"" cried impetuous J.T. Maston.

""Hear, hear!"" was heard on every side.

""But war,"" said Barbicane, ""war is impossible under actual
circumstances, and, whatever my honourable interrupter may hope, long
years will elapse before our cannons thunder on a field of battle. We
must, therefore, make up our minds to it, and seek in another order of
ideas food for the activity by which we are devoured.""
",moon_journey,verne,1865,1,1000
"
The assembly felt that its president was coming to the delicate point;
it redoubled its attention.

""A few months ago, my brave colleagues,"" continued Barbicane, ""I asked
myself if, whilst still remaining in our speciality, we could not
undertake some grand experiment worthy of the nineteenth century, and if
the progress of ballistics would not allow us to execute it with
success. I have therefore sought, worked, calculated, and the conviction
has resulted from my studies that we must succeed in an enterprise that
would seem impracticable in any other country. This project, elaborated
at length, will form the subject of my communication; it is worthy of
you, worthy of the Gun Club's past history, and cannot fail to make a
noise in the world!""

""Much noise?"" cried a passionate artilleryman.

""Much noise in the true sense of the word,"" answered Barbicane.

""Don't interrupt!"" repeated several voices.

""I therefore beg of you, my brave colleagues,"" resumed the president,
""to grant me all your attention.""

A shudder ran through the assembly. Barbicane, having with a rapid
gesture firmly fixed his hat on his head, continued his speech in a calm
tone:--

""There is not one of you, brave colleagues, who has not seen the moon,
or, at least, heard of It. Do not be astonished if I wish to speak to
you about the Queen of Night. It is, perhaps, our lot to be the
Columbuses of this unknown world. Understand me, and second me as much
as you can, I will lead you to its conquest, and its name shall be
joined to those of the thirty-six States that form the grand country of
the Union!""

""Hurrah for the moon!"" cried the Gun Club with one voice.

""The moon has been much studied,"" resumed Barbicane; ""its mass, density,
weight, volume, constitution, movements, distance, the part it plays in
the solar world, are all perfectly determined; selenographic maps have
been drawn with a perfection that equals, if it does not surpass, those
of terrestrial maps; photography has given to our satellite proofs of
incomparable beauty--in a word, all that the sciences of mathematics,
astronomy, geology, and optics can teach is known about the moon; but
until now no direct communication with it has ever been established.""

A violent movement of interest and surprise welcomed this sentence of
the orator.

""Allow me,"" he resumed, ""to recall to you in few words how certain
ardent minds, embarked upon imaginary journeys, pretended to have
penetrated the secrets of our satellite. In the seventeenth century a
certain David Fabricius boasted of having seen the inhabitants of the
moon with his own eyes. In 1649 a Frenchman, Jean Baudoin, published his
_Journey to the Moon by Dominique Gonzales, Spanish Adventurer_. At the
same epoch Cyrano de Bergerac published the celebrated expedition that
had so much success in France. Later on, another Frenchman (that nation
took a great deal of notice of the moon), named Fontenelle, wrote his
_Plurality of Worlds_, a masterpiece of his time; but science in its
progress crushes even masterpieces! About 1835, a pamphlet, translated
from the _New York American_, related that Sir John Herschel, sent to
the Cape of Good Hope, there to make astronomical observations, had, by
means of a telescope, perfected by interior lighting, brought the moon
to within a distance of eighty yards. Then he distinctly perceived
caverns in which lived hippopotami, green mountains with golden borders,
sheep with ivory horns, white deer, and inhabitants with membraneous
wings like those of bats. This treatise, the work of an American named
Locke, had a very great success. But it was soon found out that it was a
scientific mystification, and Frenchmen were the first to laugh at it.""

""Laugh at an American!"" cried J.T. Maston; ""but that's a _casus belli_!""

""Be comforted, my worthy friend; before Frenchmen laughed they were
completely taken in by our countryman. To terminate this rapid history,
I may add that a certain Hans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, went up in a balloon
filled with a gas made from azote, thirty-seven times lighter than
hydrogen, and reached the moon after a journey of nineteen days. This
journey, like the preceding attempts, was purely imaginary, but it was
the work of a popular American writer of a strange and contemplative
genius. I have named Edgar Poe!""

""Hurrah for Edgar Poe!"" cried the assembly, electrified by the words of
the president.

""I have now come to an end of these attempts which I may call purely
literary, and quite insufficient to establish any serious communications
with the Queen of Night. However, I ought to add that some practical
minds tried to put themselves into serious communication with her. Some
years ago a German mathematician proposed to send a commission of
_savants_ to the steppes of Siberia. There, on the vast plains, immense
geometrical figures were to be traced by means of luminous reflectors;
amongst others, the square of the hypothenuse, vulgarly called the
'Ass's Bridge.' 'Any intelligent being,' said the mathematician, 'ought
to understand the scientific destination of that figure. The Selenites
(inhabitants of the moon), if they exist, will answer by a similar
figure, and, communication once established, it will be easy to create
an alphabet that will allow us to hold converse with the inhabitants of
the moon.' Thus spoke the German mathematician, but his project was not
put into execution, and until now no direct communication has existed
between the earth and her satellite. But it was reserved to the
practical genius of Americans to put itself into communication with the
sidereal world. The means of doing so are simple, easy, certain,
unfailing, and will make the subject of my proposition.""
",moon_journey,verne,1865,1,945
"
Everything was perfectly swell.

There were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no
poverty, no wars.

All diseases were conquered. So was old age.

Death, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.

The population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million
souls.

One bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward
K. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man
waiting. Not many people were born a day any more.

Wehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average
age was one hundred and twenty-nine.

X-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The
children would be his first.

Young Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so
rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His
camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and
demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the
walls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.

The room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial
to a man who had volunteered to die.

A sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder,
painting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when people aged
visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five or so. Aging had
touched him that much before the cure for aging was found.

The mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women
in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings,
sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.

Men and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that
were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners.

Never, never, never--not even in medieval Holland nor old Japan--had a
garden been more formal, been better tended. Every plant had all the
loam, light, water, air and nourishment it could use.

A hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a
popular song:

     If you don't like my kisses, honey,
     Here's what I will do:
     I'll go see a girl in purple,
     Kiss this sad world toodle-oo.
     If you don't want my lovin',
     Why should I take up all this space?
     I'll get off this old planet,
     Let some sweet baby have my place.

The orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. ""Looks so real,""
he said, ""I can practically imagine I'm standing in the middle of it.""

""What makes you think you're not in it?"" said the painter. He gave a
satiric smile. ""It's called 'The Happy Garden of Life,' you know.""

""That's good of Dr. Hitz,"" said the orderly.

He was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a
portrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Hitz
was a blindingly handsome man.

""Lot of faces still to fill in,"" said the orderly. He meant that the
faces of many of the figures in the mural were still blank. All blanks
were to be filled with portraits of important people on either the
hospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of
Termination.

""Must be nice to be able to make pictures that look like something,""
said the orderly.

The painter's face curdled with scorn. ""You think I'm proud of this
daub?"" he said. ""You think this is my idea of what life really looks
like?""

""What's your idea of what life looks like?"" said the orderly.

The painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. ""There's a good picture of
it,"" he said. ""Frame that, and you'll have a picture a damn sight more
honest than this one.""

""You're a gloomy old duck, aren't you?"" said the orderly.

""Is that a crime?"" said the painter.

The orderly shrugged. ""If you don't like it here, Grandpa--"" he said,
and he finished the thought with the trick telephone number that people
who didn't want to live any more were supposed to call. The zero in the
telephone number he pronounced ""naught.""

The number was: ""2 B R 0 2 B.""

It was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful sobriquets
included: ""Automat,"" ""Birdland,"" ""Cannery,"" ""Catbox,"" ""De-louser,""
""Easy-go,"" ""Good-by, Mother,"" ""Happy Hooligan,"" ""Kiss-me-quick,"" ""Lucky
Pierre,"" ""Sheepdip,"" ""Waring Blendor,"" ""Weep-no-more"" and ""Why Worry?""

""To be or not to be"" was the telephone number of the municipal gas
chambers of the Federal Bureau of Termination.

The painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. ""When I decide it's time to
go,"" he said, ""it won't be at the Sheepdip.""

""A do-it-yourselfer, eh?"" said the orderly. ""Messy business, Grandpa.
Why don't you have a little consideration for the people who have to
clean up after you?""

The painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for the
tribulations of his survivors. ""The world could do with a good deal more
mess, if you ask me,"" he said.

The orderly laughed and moved on.

Wehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising his head.
And then he fell silent again.

A coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels.
Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple,
the purple the painter called ""the color of grapes on Judgment Day.""

The medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service
Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a
turnstile.

The woman had a lot of facial hair--an unmistakable mustache, in fact. A
curious thing about gas-chamber hostesses was that, no matter how lovely
and feminine they were when recruited, they all sprouted mustaches
within five years or so.

""Is this where I'm supposed to come?"" she said to the painter.

""A lot would depend on what your business was,"" he said. ""You aren't
about to have a baby, are you?""

""They told me I was supposed to pose for some picture,"" she said. ""My
name's Leora Duncan."" She waited.

""And you dunk people,"" he said.

""What?"" she said.

""Skip it,"" he said.

""That sure is a beautiful picture,"" she said. ""Looks just like heaven or
something.""

""Or something,"" said the painter. He took a list of names from his smock
pocket. ""Duncan, Duncan, Duncan,"" he said, scanning the list. ""Yes--here
you are. You're entitled to be immortalized. See any faceless body here
you'd like me to stick your head on? We've got a few choice ones left.""

She studied the mural bleakly. ""Gee,"" she said, ""they're all the same to
me. I don't know anything about art.""

""A body's a body, eh?"" he said. ""All righty. As a master of fine art, I
recommend this body here."" He indicated a faceless figure of a woman who
was carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner.

""Well,"" said Leora Duncan, ""that's more the disposal people, isn't it? I
mean, I'm in service. I don't do any disposing.""
",2BR02B,vonnegut,1962,1,1152
"
The painter clapped his hands in mock delight. ""You say you don't know
anything about art, and then you prove in the next breath that you know
more about it than I do! Of course the sheave-carrier is wrong for a
hostess! A snipper, a pruner--that's more your line."" He pointed to a
figure in purple who was sawing a dead branch from an apple tree. ""How
about her?"" he said. ""You like her at all?""

""Gosh--"" she said, and she blushed and became humble--""that--that puts
me right next to Dr. Hitz.""

""That upsets you?"" he said.

""Good gravy, no!"" she said. ""It's--it's just such an honor.""

""Ah, You... you admire him, eh?"" he said.

""Who doesn't admire him?"" she said, worshiping the portrait of Hitz. It
was the portrait of a tanned, white-haired, omnipotent Zeus, two hundred
and forty years old. ""Who doesn't admire him?"" she said again. ""He was
responsible for setting up the very first gas chamber in Chicago.""

""Nothing would please me more,"" said the painter, ""than to put you next
to him for all time. Sawing off a limb--that strikes you as
appropriate?""

""That is kind of like what I do,"" she said. She was demure about what
she did. What she did was make people comfortable while she killed them.

And, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the
waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he
boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living.

""Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!"" he said, and he made a joke. ""What
are you doing here?"" he said. ""This isn't where the people leave. This
is where they come in!""

""We're going to be in the same picture together,"" she said shyly.

""Good!"" said Dr. Hitz heartily. ""And, say, isn't that some picture?""

""I sure am honored to be in it with you,"" she said.

""Let me tell you,"" he said, ""I'm honored to be in it with you. Without
women like you, this wonderful world we've got wouldn't be possible.""

He saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the delivery rooms.
""Guess what was just born,"" he said.

""I can't,"" she said.

""Triplets!"" he said.

""Triplets!"" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of
triplets.

The law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of
the child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if
they were all to live, called for three volunteers.

""Do the parents have three volunteers?"" said Leora Duncan.

""Last I heard,"" said Dr. Hitz, ""they had one, and were trying to scrape
another two up.""

""I don't think they made it,"" she said. ""Nobody made three appointments
with us. Nothing but singles going through today, unless somebody
called in after I left. What's the name?""

""Wehling,"" said the waiting father, sitting up, red-eyed and frowzy.
""Edward K. Wehling, Jr., is the name of the happy father-to-be.""

He raised his right hand, looked at a spot on the wall, gave a hoarsely
wretched chuckle. ""Present,"" he said.

""Oh, Mr. Wehling,"" said Dr. Hitz, ""I didn't see you.""

""The invisible man,"" said Wehling.

""They just phoned me that your triplets have been born,"" said Dr. Hitz.
""They're all fine, and so is the mother. I'm on my way in to see them
now.""

""Hooray,"" said Wehling emptily.

""You don't sound very happy,"" said Dr. Hitz.

""What man in my shoes wouldn't be happy?"" said Wehling. He gestured with
his hands to symbolize care-free simplicity. ""All I have to do is pick
out which one of the triplets is going to live, then deliver my maternal
grandfather to the Happy Hooligan, and come back here with a receipt.""

Dr. Hitz became rather severe with Wehling, towered over him. ""You don't
believe in population control, Mr. Wehling?"" he said.

""I think it's perfectly keen,"" said Wehling tautly.

""Would you like to go back to the good old days, when the population of
the Earth was twenty billion--about to become forty billion, then eighty
billion, then one hundred and sixty billion? Do you know what a drupelet
is, Mr. Wehling?"" said Hitz.

""Nope,"" said Wehling sulkily.

""A drupelet, Mr. Wehling, is one of the little knobs, one of the little
pulpy grains of a blackberry,"" said Dr. Hitz. ""Without population
control, human beings would now be packed on this surface of this old
planet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of it!""

Wehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall.

""In the year 2000,"" said Dr. Hitz, ""before scientists stepped in and
laid down the law, there wasn't even enough drinking water to go around,
and nothing to eat but sea-weed--and still people insisted on their
right to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their right, if possible, to
live forever.""

""I want those kids,"" said Wehling quietly. ""I want all three of them.""

""Of course you do,"" said Dr. Hitz. ""That's only human.""

""I don't want my grandfather to die, either,"" said Wehling.

""Nobody's really happy about taking a close relative to the Catbox,""
said Dr. Hitz gently, sympathetically.

""I wish people wouldn't call it that,"" said Leora Duncan.

""What?"" said Dr. Hitz.

""I wish people wouldn't call it 'the Catbox,' and things like that,"" she
said. ""It gives people the wrong impression.""

""You're absolutely right,"" said Dr. Hitz. ""Forgive me."" He corrected
himself, gave the municipal gas chambers their official title, a title
no one ever used in conversation. ""I should have said, 'Ethical Suicide
Studios,'"" he said.

""That sounds so much better,"" said Leora Duncan.

""This child of yours--whichever one you decide to keep, Mr. Wehling,""
said Dr. Hitz. ""He or she is going to live on a happy, roomy, clean,
rich planet, thanks to population control. In a garden like that mural
there."" He shook his head. ""Two centuries ago, when I was a young man,
it was a hell that nobody thought could last another twenty years. Now
centuries of peace and plenty stretch before us as far as the
imagination cares to travel.""

He smiled luminously.

The smile faded as he saw that Wehling had just drawn a revolver.

Wehling shot Dr. Hitz dead. ""There's room for one--a great big one,"" he
said.

And then he shot Leora Duncan. ""It's only death,"" he said to her as she
fell. ""There! Room for two.""

And then he shot himself, making room for all three of his children.

Nobody came running. Nobody, seemingly, heard the shots.

The painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down reflectively
on the sorry scene.

The painter pondered the mournful puzzle of life demanding to be born
and, once born, demanding to be fruitful ... to multiply and to live as
long as possible--to do all that on a very small planet that would have
to last forever.

All the answers that the painter could think of were grim. Even grimmer,
surely, than a Catbox, a Happy Hooligan, an Easy Go. He thought of war.
He thought of plague. He thought of starvation.

He knew that he would never paint again. He let his paintbrush fall to
the dropcloths below. And then he decided he had had about enough of
life in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he came slowly down from the
ladder.

He took Wehling's pistol, really intending to shoot himself.

But he didn't have the nerve.

And then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room. He went
to it, dialed the well-remembered number: ""2 B R 0 2 B.""

""Federal Bureau of Termination,"" said the very warm voice of a hostess.

""How soon could I get an appointment?"" he asked, speaking very
carefully.

""We could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir,"" she said. ""It
might even be earlier, if we get a cancellation.""

""All right,"" said the painter, ""fit me in, if you please."" And he gave
her his name, spelling it out.

""Thank you, sir,"" said the hostess. ""Your city thanks you; your country
thanks you; your planet thanks you. But the deepest thanks of all is
from future generations.""

    _If it was good enough for your grandfather, forget it ... it is
    much too good for anyone else!_


Gramps Ford, his chin resting on his hands, his hands on the crook of
his cane, was staring irascibly at the five-foot television screen that
dominated the room. On the screen, a news commentator was summarizing
the day's happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, Gramps would jab the
floor with his cane-tip and shout, ""Hell, we did that a hundred years
ago!""

Emerald and Lou, coming in from the balcony, where they had been seeking
that 2185 A.D. rarity--privacy--were obliged to take seats in the back
row, behind Lou's father and mother, brother and sister-in-law, son and
daughter-in-law, grandson and wife, granddaughter and husband,
great-grandson and wife, nephew and wife, grandnephew and wife,
great-grandniece and husband, great-grandnephew and wife--and, of
course, Gramps, who was in front of everybody. All save Gramps, who was
somewhat withered and bent, seemed, by pre-anti-gerasone standards, to
be about the same age--somewhere in their late twenties or early
thirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 70 when
anti-gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 102 years since.

""Meanwhile,"" the commentator was saying, ""Council Bluffs, Iowa, was
still threatened by stark tragedy. But 200 weary rescue workers have
refused to give up hope, and continue to dig in an effort to save Elbert
Haggedorn, 183, who has been wedged for two days in a ...""

""I wish he'd get something more cheerful,"" Emerald whispered to Lou.

""Silence!"" cried Gramps. ""Next one shoots off his big bazoo while the
TV's on is gonna find hisself cut off without a dollar--"" his voice
suddenly softened and sweetened--""when they wave that checkered flag at
the Indianapolis Speedway, and old Gramps gets ready for the Big Trip Up
Yonder.""

He sniffed sentimentally, while his heirs concentrated desperately on
not making the slightest sound. For them, the poignancy of the
prospective Big Trip had been dulled somewhat, through having been
mentioned by Gramps about once a day for fifty years.

""Dr. Brainard Keyes Bullard,"" continued the commentator, ""President of
Wyandotte College, said in an address tonight that most of the world's
ills can be traced to the fact that Man's knowledge of himself has not
kept pace with his knowledge of the physical world.""

""_Hell!_"" snorted Gramps. ""We said _that_ a hundred years ago!""

""In Chicago tonight,"" the commentator went on, ""a special celebration is
taking place in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. The guest of honor
is Lowell W. Hitz, age zero. Hitz, born this morning, is the
twenty-five-millionth child to be born in the hospital."" The commentator
faded, and was replaced on the screen by young Hitz, who squalled
furiously.

""Hell!"" whispered Lou to Emerald. ""We said that a hundred years ago.""

""I heard that!"" shouted Gramps. He snapped off the television set and
his petrified descendants stared silently at the screen. ""You, there,
boy--""

""I didn't mean anything by it, sir,"" said Lou, aged 103.

""Get me my will. You know where it is. You kids _all_ know where it is.
Fetch, boy!"" Gramps snapped his gnarled fingers sharply.

Lou nodded dully and found himself going down the hall, picking his way
over bedding to Gramps' room, the only private room in the Ford
apartment. The other rooms were the bathroom, the living room and the
wide windowless hallway, which was originally intended to serve as a
dining area, and which had a kitchenette in one end. Six mattresses and
four sleeping bags were dispersed in the hallway and living room, and
the daybed, in the living room, accommodated the eleventh couple, the
favorites of the moment.

On Gramps' bureau was his will, smeared, dog-eared, perforated and
blotched with hundreds of additions, deletions, accusations, conditions,
warnings, advice and homely philosophy. The document was, Lou reflected,
a fifty-year diary, all jammed onto two sheets--a garbled, illegible log
of day after day of strife. This day, Lou would be disinherited for the
eleventh time, and it would take him perhaps six months of impeccable
behavior to regain the promise of a share in the estate. To say nothing
of the daybed in the living room for Em and himself.

""Boy!"" called Gramps.

""Coming, sir."" Lou hurried back into the living room and handed Gramps
the will.

""Pen!"" said Gramps.

He was instantly offered eleven pens, one from each couple.

""Not _that_ leaky thing,"" he said, brushing Lou's pen aside. ""Ah,
_there's_ a nice one. Good boy, Willy."" He accepted Willy's pen. That
was the tip they had all been waiting for. Willy, then--Lou's
father--was the new favorite.

Willy, who looked almost as young as Lou, though he was 142, did a poor
job of concealing his pleasure. He glanced shyly at the daybed, which
would become his, and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back
into the hall, back to the worst spot of all by the bathroom door.
",trip_up_yonder,vonnegut,1953,1,824
"
Gramps missed none of the high drama he had authored and he gave his own
familiar role everything he had. Frowning and running his finger along
each line, as though he were seeing the will for the first time, he read
aloud in a deep portentous monotone, like a bass note on a cathedral
organ.

[Illustration]

""I, Harold D. Ford, residing in Building 257 of Alden Village, New York
City, Connecticut, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my
last Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and
codicils by me at any time heretofore made."" He blew his nose
importantly and went on, not missing a word, and repeating many for
emphasis--repeating in particular his ever-more-elaborate specifications
for a funeral.

At the end of these specifications, Gramps was so choked with emotion
that Lou thought he might have forgotten why he'd brought out the will
in the first place. But Gramps heroically brought his powerful emotions
under control and, after erasing for a full minute, began to write and
speak at the same time. Lou could have spoken his lines for him, he had
heard them so often.

""I have had many heartbreaks ere leaving this vale of tears for a better
land,"" Gramps said and wrote. ""But the deepest hurt of all has been
dealt me by--"" He looked around the group, trying to remember who the
malefactor was.

Everyone looked helpfully at Lou, who held up his hand resignedly.

Gramps nodded, remembering, and completed the sentence--""my
great-grandson, Louis J. Ford.""

""Grandson, sir,"" said Lou.

""Don't quibble. You're in deep enough now, young man,"" said Gramps, but
he made the change. And, from there, he went without a misstep through
the phrasing of the disinheritance, causes for which were
disrespectfulness and quibbling.

In the paragraph following, the paragraph that had belonged to everyone
in the room at one time or another, Lou's name was scratched out and
Willy's substituted as heir to the apartment and, the biggest plum of
all, the double bed in the private bedroom.

""So!"" said Gramps, beaming. He erased the date at the foot of the will
and substituted a new one, including the time of day. ""Well--time to
watch the McGarvey Family."" The McGarvey Family was a television serial
that Gramps had been following since he was 60, or for a total of 112
years. ""I can't wait to see what's going to happen next,"" he said.

Lou detached himself from the group and lay down on his bed of pain by
the bathroom door. Wishing Em would join him, he wondered where she was.

He dozed for a few moments, until he was disturbed by someone stepping
over him to get into the bathroom. A moment later, he heard a faint
gurgling sound, as though something were being poured down the washbasin
drain. Suddenly, it entered his mind that Em had cracked up, that she
was in there doing something drastic about Gramps.

""Em?"" he whispered through the panel. There was no reply, and Lou
pressed against the door. The worn lock, whose bolt barely engaged its
socket, held for a second, then let the door swing inward.

""Morty!"" gasped Lou.

Lou's great-grandnephew, Mortimer, who had just married and brought his
wife home to the Ford menage, looked at Lou with consternation and
surprise. Morty kicked the door shut, but not before Lou had glimpsed
what was in his hand--Gramps' enormous economy-size bottle of
anti-gerasone, which had apparently been half-emptied, and which Morty
was refilling with tap water.

A moment later, Morty came out, glared defiantly at Lou and brushed past
him wordlessly to rejoin his pretty bride.

Shocked, Lou didn't know what to do. He couldn't let Gramps take the
mousetrapped anti-gerasone--but, if he warned Gramps about it, Gramps
would certainly make life in the apartment, which was merely
insufferable now, harrowing.

Lou glanced into the living room and saw that the Fords, Emerald among
them, were momentarily at rest, relishing the botches that the McGarveys
had made of _their_ lives. Stealthily, he went into the bathroom, locked
the door as well as he could and began to pour the contents of Gramps'
bottle down the drain. He was going to refill it with full-strength
anti-gerasone from the 22 smaller bottles on the shelf.

The bottle contained a half-gallon, and its neck was small, so it seemed
to Lou that the emptying would take forever. And the almost
imperceptible smell of anti-gerasone, like Worcestershire sauce, now
seemed to Lou, in his nervousness, to be pouring out into the rest of
the apartment, through the keyhole and under the door.

The bottle gurgled monotonously. Suddenly, up came the sound of music
from the living room and there were murmurs and the scraping of
chair-legs on the floor. ""Thus ends,"" said the television announcer,
""the 29,121st chapter in the life of your neighbors and mine, the
McGarveys."" Footsteps were coming down the hall. There was a knock on
the bathroom door.

""Just a sec,"" Lou cheerily called out. Desperately, he shook the big
bottle, trying to speed up the flow. His palms slipped on the wet glass,
and the heavy bottle smashed on the tile floor.

The door was pushed open, and Gramps, dumbfounded, stared at the
incriminating mess.
",trip_up_yonder,vonnegut,1953,1,880
"
Lou felt a hideous prickling sensation on his scalp and the back of his
neck. He grinned engagingly through his nausea and, for want of anything
remotely resembling a thought, waited for Gramps to speak.

""Well, boy,"" said Gramps at last, ""looks like you've got a little
tidying up to do.""

And that was all he said. He turned around, elbowed his way through the
crowd and locked himself in his bedroom.

The Fords contemplated Lou in incredulous silence a moment longer, and
then hurried back to the living room, as though some of his horrible
guilt would taint them, too, if they looked too long. Morty stayed
behind long enough to give Lou a quizzical, annoyed glance. Then he also
went into the living room, leaving only Emerald standing in the doorway.

Tears streamed over her cheeks. ""Oh, you poor lamb--_please_ don't look
so awful! It was my fault. I put you up to this with my nagging about
Gramps.""

""No,"" said Lou, finding his voice, ""really you didn't. Honest, Em, I was
just--""

""You don't have to explain anything to me, hon. I'm on your side, no
matter what."" She kissed him on one cheek and whispered in his ear, ""It
wouldn't have been murder, hon. It wouldn't have killed him. It wasn't
such a terrible thing to do. It just would have fixed him up so he'd be
able to go any time God decided He wanted him.""

""What's going to happen next, Em?"" said Lou hollowly. ""What's he going
to do?""

Lou and Emerald stayed fearfully awake almost all night, waiting to see
what Gramps was going to do. But not a sound came from the sacred
bedroom. Two hours before dawn, they finally dropped off to sleep.

At six o'clock, they arose again, for it was time for their generation
to eat breakfast in the kitchenette. No one spoke to them. They had
twenty minutes in which to eat, but their reflexes were so dulled by the
bad night that they had hardly swallowed two mouthfuls of egg-type
processed seaweed before it was time to surrender their places to their
son's generation.

Then, as was the custom for whoever had been most recently disinherited,
they began preparing Gramps' breakfast, which would presently be served
to him in bed, on a tray. They tried to be cheerful about it. The
toughest part of the job was having to handle the honest-to-God eggs and
bacon and oleomargarine, on which Gramps spent so much of the income
from his fortune.

""Well,"" said Emerald, ""I'm not going to get all panicky until I'm sure
there's something to be panicky about.""

""Maybe he doesn't know what it was I busted,"" Lou said hopefully.

""Probably thinks it was your watch crystal,"" offered Eddie, their son,
who was toying apathetically with his buckwheat-type processed sawdust
cakes.

""Don't get sarcastic with your father,"" said Em, ""and don't talk with
your mouth full, either.""

""I'd like to see anybody take a mouthful of this stuff and _not_ say
something,"" complained Eddie, who was 73. He glanced at the clock. ""It's
time to take Gramps his breakfast, you know.""

""Yeah, it is, isn't it?"" said Lou weakly. He shrugged. ""Let's have the
tray, Em.""

""We'll both go.""

Walking slowly, smiling bravely, they found a large semi-circle of
long-faced Fords standing around the bedroom door.

Em knocked. ""Gramps,"" she called brightly, ""_break_-fast is _rea_-dy.""

There was no reply and she knocked again, harder.

The door swung open before her fist. In the middle of the room, the
soft, deep, wide, canopied bed, the symbol of the sweet by-and-by to
every Ford, was empty.

A sense of death, as unfamiliar to the Fords as Zoroastrianism or the
causes of the Sepoy Mutiny, stilled every voice, slowed every heart.
Awed, the heirs began to search gingerly, under the furniture and behind
the drapes, for all that was mortal of Gramps, father of the clan.

But Gramps had left not his Earthly husk but a note, which Lou finally
found on the dresser, under a paperweight which was a treasured souvenir
from the World's Fair of 2000. Unsteadily, Lou read it aloud:

""'Somebody who I have sheltered and protected and taught the best I know
how all these years last night turned on me like a mad dog and diluted
my anti-gerasone, or tried to. I am no longer a young man. I can no
longer bear the crushing burden of life as I once could. So, after last
night's bitter experience, I say good-by. The cares of this world will
soon drop away like a cloak of thorns and I shall know peace. By the
time you find this, I will be gone.'""

""Gosh,"" said Willy brokenly, ""he didn't even get to see how the
5000-mile Speedway Race was going to come out.""

""Or the Solar Series,"" Eddie said, with large mournful eyes.

""Or whether Mrs. McGarvey got her eyesight back,"" added Morty.
",trip_up_yonder,vonnegut,1953,1,825
"
""There's more,"" said Lou, and he began reading aloud again: ""'I, Harold
D. Ford, etc., do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my last
Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me
at any time heretofore made.'""

""No!"" cried Willy. ""Not another one!""

""'I do stipulate,'"" read Lou, ""'that all of my property, of whatsoever
kind and nature, not be divided, but do devise and bequeath it to be
held in common by my issue, without regard for generation, equally,
share and share alike.'""

""Issue?"" said Emerald.

Lou included the multitude in a sweep of his hand. ""It means we all own
the whole damn shootin' match.""

Each eye turned instantly to the bed.

""Share and share alike?"" asked Morty.

""Actually,"" said Willy, who was the oldest one present, ""it's just like
the old system, where the oldest people head up things with their
headquarters in here and--""

""I like _that_!"" exclaimed Em. ""Lou owns as much of it as you do, and I
say it ought to be for the oldest one who's still working. You can
snooze around here all day, waiting for your pension check, while poor
Lou stumbles in here after work, all tuckered out, and--""

""How about letting somebody who's never had _any_ privacy get a little
crack at it?"" Eddie demanded hotly. ""Hell, you old people had plenty of
privacy back when you were kids. I was born and raised in the middle of
that goddamn barracks in the hall! How about--""

""Yeah?"" challenged Morty. ""Sure, you've all had it pretty tough, and my
heart bleeds for you. But try honeymooning in the hall for a real kick.""

""_Silence!_"" shouted Willy imperiously. ""The next person who opens his
mouth spends the next sixth months by the bathroom. Now clear out of my
room. I want to think.""

A vase shattered against the wall, inches above his head.

In the next moment, a free-for-all was under way, with each couple
battling to eject every other couple from the room. Fighting coalitions
formed and dissolved with the lightning changes of the tactical
situation. Em and Lou were thrown into the hall, where they organized
others in the same situation, and stormed back into the room.

After two hours of struggle, with nothing like a decision in sight, the
cops broke in, followed by television cameramen from mobile units.

For the next half-hour, patrol wagons and ambulances hauled away Fords,
and then the apartment was still and spacious.

An hour later, films of the last stages of the riot were being televised
to 500,000,000 delighted viewers on the Eastern Seaboard.

In the stillness of the three-room Ford apartment on the 76th floor of
Building 257, the television set had been left on. Once more the air was
filled with the cries and grunts and crashes of the fray, coming
harmlessly now from the loudspeaker.

The battle also appeared on the screen of the television set in the
police station, where the Fords and their captors watched with
professional interest.

Em and Lou, in adjacent four-by-eight cells, were stretched out
peacefully on their cots.

""Em,"" called Lou through the partition, ""you got a washbasin all your
own, too?""

""Sure. Washbasin, bed, light--the works. And we thought _Gramps'_ room
was something. How long has this been going on?"" She held out her hand.
""For the first time in forty years, hon, I haven't got the shakes--look
at me!""

""Cross your fingers,"" said Lou. ""The lawyer's going to try to get us a
year.""

""Gee!"" Em said dreamily. ""I wonder what kind of wires you'd have to pull
to get put away in solitary?""

""All right, pipe down,"" said the turnkey, ""or I'll toss the whole kit
and caboodle of you right out. And first one who lets on to anybody
outside how good jail is ain't never getting back in!""

The prisoners instantly fell silent.

The living room of the apartment darkened for a moment as the riot
scenes faded on the television screen, and then the face of the
announcer appeared, like the Sun coming from behind a cloud. ""And now,
friends,"" he said, ""I have a special message from the makers of
anti-gerasone, a message for all you folks over 150. Are you hampered
socially by wrinkles, by stiffness of joints and discoloration or loss
of hair, all because these things came upon you before anti-gerasone was
developed? Well, if you are, you need no longer suffer, need no longer
feel different and out of things.

""After years of research, medical science has now developed
_Super_-anti-gerasone! In weeks--yes, weeks--you can look, feel and act
as young as your great-great-grandchildren! Wouldn't you pay $5,000 to
be indistinguishable from everybody else? Well, you don't have to. Safe,
tested _Super_-anti-gerasone costs you only a few dollars a day.

""Write now for your free trial carton. Just put your name and address on
a dollar postcard, and mail it to '_Super_,' Box 500,000, Schenectady,
N. Y. Have you got that? I'll repeat it. '_Super_,' Box 500,000 ...""

Underlining the announcer's words was the scratching of Gramps' pen, the
one Willy had given him the night before. He had come in, a few minutes
earlier, from the Idle Hour Tavern, which commanded a view of Building
257 from across the square of asphalt known as the Alden Village Green.
He had called a cleaning woman to come straighten the place up, then had
hired the best lawyer in town to get his descendants a conviction, a
genius who had never gotten a client less than a year and a day. Gramps
had then moved the daybed before the television screen, so that he could
watch from a reclining position. It was something he'd dreamed of doing
for years.

""Schen-_ec_-ta-dy,"" murmured Gramps. ""Got it!"" His face had changed
remarkably. His facial muscles seemed to have relaxed, revealing
kindness and equanimity under what had been taut lines of bad temper. It
was almost as though his trial package of _Super_-anti-gerasone had
already arrived. When something amused him on television, he smiled
easily, rather than barely managing to lengthen the thin line of his
mouth a millimeter.

Life was good. He could hardly wait to see what was going to happen
next.
",trip_up_yonder,vonnegut,1953,1,1044
"
While from that former point of view our life is simply to reap the
consequences of the past, from this our life is to prepare the future.
The former type one might speak of as the legal or submissive type of
mind, because the business, the practice, and the training of a lawyer
dispose him toward it; he of all men must constantly refer to the law
made, the right established, the precedent set, and consistently ignore
or condemn the thing that is only seeking to establish itself. The
latter type of mind I might for contrast call the legislative, creative,
organizing, or masterful type, because it is perpetually attacking and
altering the established order of things, perpetually falling away from
respect for what the past has given us. It sees the world as one great
workshop, and the present is no more than material for the future,
for the thing that is yet destined to be. It is in the active mood of
thought, while the former is in the passive; it is the mind of youth, it
is the mind more manifest among the western nations, while the former is
the mind of age, the mind of the oriental.

Things have been, says the legal mind, and so we are here. The creative
mind says we are here because things have yet to be.

Now I do not wish to suggest that the great mass of people belong to
either of these two types. Indeed, I speak of them as two distinct and
distinguishable types mainly for convenience and in order to accentuate
their distinction. There are probably very few people who brood
constantly upon the past without any thought of the future at all, and
there are probably scarcely any who live and think consistently in
relation to the future. The great mass of people occupy an intermediate
position between these extremes, they pass daily and hourly from the
passive mood to the active, they see this thing in relation to its
associations and that thing in relation to its consequences, and they
do not even suspect that they are using two distinct methods in their
minds.

But for all that they are distinct methods, the method of reference to
the past and the method of reference to the future, and their mingling
in many of our minds no more abolishes their difference than the
existence of piebald horses proves that white is black.

I believe that it is not sufficiently recognized just how different
in their consequences these two methods are, and just where their
difference and where the failure to appreciate their difference takes
one. This present time is a period of quite extraordinary uncertainty
and indecision upon endless questions--moral questions, æsthetic
questions, religious and political questions--upon which we should all
of us be happier to feel assured and settled; and a very large amount of
this floating uncertainty about these important matters is due to the
fact that with most of us these two insufficiently distinguished ways of
looking at things are not only present together, but in actual conflict
in our minds, in unsuspected conflict; we pass from one to the other
heedlessly without any clear recognition of the fundamental difference
in conclusions that exists between the two, and we do this with
disastrous results to our confidence and to our consistency in dealing
with all sorts of things.

But before pointing out how divergent these two types or habits of
mind really are, it is necessary to meet a possible objection to what
has been said. I may put that objection in this form: Is not this
distinction between a type of mind that thinks of the past and a type
of mind that thinks of the future a sort of hair-splitting, almost like
distinguishing between people who have left hands and people who have
right? Everybody believes that the present is entirely determined by
the past, you say; but then everybody believes also that the present
determines the future. Are we simply separating and contrasting two
sides of everybody's opinion? To which one replies that we are not
discussing what we know and believe about the relations of past,
present, and future, or of the relation of cause and effect to each
other in time. We all know the present depends for its causes on the
past, and the future depends for its causes upon the present. But this
discussion concerns the way in which we approach things upon this
common ground of knowledge and belief. We may all know there is an
east and a west, but if some of us always approach and look at things
from the west, if some of us always approach and look at things from
the east, and if others again wander about with a pretty disregard of
direction, looking at things as chance determines, some of us will get
to a westward conclusion of this journey, and some of us will get to an
eastward conclusion, and some of us will get to no definite conclusion
at all about all sorts of important matters. And yet those who are
travelling east, and those who are travelling west, and those who are
wandering haphazard, may be all upon the same ground of belief and
statement and amid the same assembly of proven facts. Precisely the same
thing, divergence of result, will happen if you always approach things
from the point of view of their causes, or if you approach them always
with a view to their probable effects. And in several very important
groups of human affairs it is possible to show quite clearly just how
widely apart the two methods, pursued each in its purity, take those who
follow them.

I suppose that three hundred years ago all people who thought at all
about moral questions, about questions of Right and Wrong, deduced their
rules of conduct absolutely and unreservedly from the past, from some
dogmatic injunction, some finally settled decree. The great mass of
people do so to-day. It is written, they say. ""Thou shalt not steal,""
for example--that is the sole, complete, sufficient reason why you
should not steal, and even to-day there is a strong aversion to admit
that there is any relation between the actual consequences of acts and
the imperatives of right and wrong. Our lives are to reap the fruits
of determinate things, and it is still a fundamental presumption of the
established morality that one must do right though the heavens fall.
But there are people coming into this world who would refuse to call it
Right if it brought the heavens about our heads, however authoritative
its sources and sanctions, and this new disposition is, I believe,
a growing one. I suppose in all ages people in a timid, hesitating,
guilty way have tempered the austerity of a dogmatic moral code by
small infractions to secure obviously kindly ends, but it was, I am
told, the Jesuits who first deliberately sought to qualify the moral
interpretation of acts by a consideration of their results. To-day there
are few people who have not more or less clearly discovered the future
as a more or less important factor in moral considerations. To-day there
is a certain small proportion of people who frankly regard morality
as a means to an end, as an overriding of immediate and personal
considerations out of regard to something to be attained in the future,
and who break away altogether from the idea of a code dogmatically
established forever.
",discovery_future,wells,1913,0,1256
"
Most of us are not so definite as that, but most of us are deeply
tinged with the spirit of compromise between the past and the future;
we profess an unbounded allegiance to the prescriptions of the past,
and we practise a general observance of its injunctions, but we qualify
to a vague, variable extent with considerations of expediency. We hold,
for example, that we must respect our promises. But suppose we find
unexpectedly that for one of us to keep a promise, which has been sealed
and sworn in the most sacred fashion, must lead to the great suffering
of some other human being, must lead, in fact, to practical evil? Would
a man do right or wrong if he broke such a promise? The practical
decision most modern people would make would be to break the promise.
Most would say that they did evil to avoid a greater evil. But suppose
it was not such very great suffering we were going to inflict, but only
some suffering? And suppose it was a rather important promise? With most
of us it would then come to be a matter of weighing the promise, the
thing of the past, against this unexpected bad consequence, the thing of
the future. And the smaller the overplus of evil consequences the more
most of us would vacillate. But neither of the two types of mind we are
contrasting would vacillate at all. The legal type of mind would obey
the past unhesitatingly, the creative would unhesitatingly sacrifice it
to the future. The legal mind would say, ""they who break the law at any
point break it altogether,"" while the creative mind would say, ""let the
dead past bury its dead.""

It is convenient to take my illustration from the sphere of promises,
but it is in the realm of sexual morality that the two methods are most
acutely in conflict.

And I would like to suggest that until you have definitely determined
either to obey the real or imaginary imperatives of the past, or to set
yourself toward the demands of some ideal of the future, until you have
made up your mind to adhere to one or other of these two types of mental
action in these matters, you are not even within hope of a sustained
consistency in the thought that underlies your acts, that in every issue
of principle that comes upon you, you will be entirely at the mercy of
the intellectual mood that happens to be ascendent at that particular
moment in your mind.

In the sphere of public affairs also these two ways of looking at things
work out into equally divergent and incompatible consequences. The legal
mind insists upon treaties, constitutions, legitimacies, and charters;
the legislative incessantly assails these. Whenever some period of
stress sets in, some great conflict between institutions and the forces
in things, there comes a sorting out of these two types of mind. The
legal mind becomes glorified and transfigured in the form of hopeless
loyalty, the creative mind inspires revolutions and reconstructions.
And particularly is this difference of attitude accentuated in the
disputes that arise out of wars. In most modern wars there is no doubt
quite traceable on one side or the other a distinct creative idea, a
distinct regard for some future consequence; but the main dispute even
in most modern wars and the sole dispute in most mediæval wars will
be found to be a reference, not to the future, but to the past; to
turn upon a question of fact and right. The wars of Plantagenet and
Lancastrian England with France, for example, were based entirely upon
a dummy claim, supported by obscure legal arguments, upon the crown of
France. And the arguments that centered about the late war in South
Africa ignored any ideal of a great united South African state almost
entirely, and quibbled this way and that about who began the fighting
and what was or was not written in some obscure revision of a treaty a
score of years ago. Yet beneath the legal issues the broad creative idea
has been apparent in the public mind during this war. It will be found
more or less definitely formulated beneath almost all the great wars of
the past century, and a comparison of the wars of the nineteenth century
with the wars of the middle ages will show, I think, that in this field
also there has been a discovery of the future, an increasing disposition
to shift the reference and values from things accomplished to things to
come.

Yet though foresight creeps into our politics and a reference to
consequence into our morality, it is still the past that dominates our
lives. But why? Why are we so bound to it? It is into the future we go,
to-morrow is the eventful thing for us. There lies all that remains to
be felt by us and our children and all those that are dear to us. Yet we
marshal and order men into classes entirely with regard to the past; we
draw shame and honor out of the past; against the rights of property,
the vested interests, the agreements and establishments of the past
the future has no rights. Literature is for the most part history or
history at one remove, and what is culture but a mold of interpretation
into which new things are thrust, a collection of standards, a sort
of bed of King Og, to which all new expressions must be lopped or
stretched? Our conveniences, like our thoughts, are all retrospective.
We travel on roads so narrow that they suffocate our traffic; we live
in uncomfortable, inconvenient, life-wasting houses out of a love of
familiar shapes and familiar customs and a dread of strangeness; all our
public affairs are cramped by local boundaries impossibly restricted
and small. Our clothing, our habits of speech, our spelling, our weights
and measures, our coinage, our religious and political theories, all
witness to the binding power of the past upon our minds. Yet we do
not serve the past as the Chinese have done. There are degrees. We do
not worship our ancestors or prescribe a rigid local costume; we dare
to enlarge our stock of knowledge, and we qualify the classics with
occasional adventures into original thought. Compared with the Chinese
we are distinctly aware of the future. But compared with what we might
be, the past is all our world.
",discovery_future,wells,1913,0,1078
"
The reason why the retrospective habit, the legal habit, is so dominant,
and always has been so predominant, is of course a perfectly obvious
one. We follow a fundamental human principle and take what we can get.
All people believe the past is certain, defined, and knowable, and only
a few people believe that it is possible to know anything about the
future. Man has acquired the habit of going to the past because it was
the line of least resistance for his mind. While a certain variable
portion of the past is serviceable matter for knowledge in the case of
everyone, the future is, to a mind without an imagination trained in
scientific habits of thought, non-existent. All our minds are made of
memories. In our memories each of us has something that without any
special training whatever will go back into the past and grip firmly and
convincingly all sorts of workable facts, sometimes more convincingly
than firmly. But the imagination, unless it is strengthened by a very
sound training in the laws of causation, wanders like a lost child in
the blankness of things to come and returns empty.

Many people believe, therefore, that there can be no sort of certainty
about the future. You can know no more about the future, I was
recently assured by a friend, than you can know which way a kitten will
jump next. And to all who hold that view, who regard the future as a
perpetual source of convulsive surprises, as an impenetrable, incurable,
perpetual blankness, it is right and reasonable to derive such values as
it is necessary to attach to things from the events that have certainly
happened with regard to them. It is our ignorance of the future and our
persuasion that that ignorance is absolutely incurable that alone gives
the past its enormous predominance in our thoughts. But through the
ages, the long unbroken succession of fortune-tellers--and they flourish
still--witnesses to the perpetually smoldering feeling that after all
there may be a better sort of knowledge--a more serviceable sort of
knowledge than that we now possess.

On the whole there is something sympathetic for the dupe of the
fortune-teller in the spirit of modern science; it is one of the
persuasions that come into one's mind, as one assimilates the broad
conception of science, that the adequacy of causation is universal; that
in absolute fact--if not in that little bubble of relative fact which
constitutes the individual life--in absolute fact the future is just as
fixed and determinate, just as settled and inevitable, just as possible
a matter of knowledge as the past. Our personal memory gives us an
impression of the superior reality and trustworthiness of things in the
past, as of things that have finally committed themselves and said their
say, but the more clearly we master the leading conceptions of science
the better we understand that this impression is one of the results of
the peculiar conditions of our lives, and not an absolute truth. The man
of science comes to believe at last that the events of the year A.D.
4000 are as fixed, settled, and unchangeable as the events of the year
1600. Only about the latter he has some material for belief and about
the former practically none.

And the question arises how far this absolute ignorance of the future
is a fixed and necessary condition of human life, and how far some
application of intellectual methods may not attenuate even if it does
not absolutely set aside the veil between ourselves and things to come.
And I am venturing to suggest to you that along certain lines and with
certain qualifications and limitations a working knowledge of things in
the future is a possible and practicable thing. And in order to support
this suggestion I would call your attention to certain facts about our
knowledge of the past, and more particularly I would insist upon this,
that about the past our range of absolute certainty is very limited
indeed. About the past I would suggest we are inclined to overestimate
our certainty, just as I think we are inclined to underestimate the
certainties of the future. And such a knowledge of the past as we have
is not all of the same sort or derived from the same sources.

Let us consider just what an educated man of to-day knows of the past.
First of all he has the realest of all knowledge--the knowledge of his
own personal experiences, his memory. Uneducated people believe their
memories absolutely, and most educated people believe them with a few
reservations. Some of us take up a critical attitude even toward our own
memories; we know that they not only sometimes drop things out, but that
sometimes a sort of dreaming or a strong suggestion will put things in.
But for all that, memory remains vivid and real as no other knowledge
can be, and to have seen and heard and felt is to be nearest to absolute
conviction. Yet our memory of direct impressions is only the smallest
part of what we know. Outside that bright area comes knowledge of a
different order--the knowledge brought to us by other people. Outside
our immediate personal memory there comes this wider area of facts or
quasi facts told us by more or less trustworthy people, told us by word
of mouth or by the written word of living and of dead writers. This is
the past of report, rumor, tradition, and history--the second sort of
knowledge of the past. The nearer knowledge of this sort is abundant
and clear and detailed, remoter it becomes vaguer, still more remotely
in time and space it dies down to brief, imperfect inscriptions and
enigmatical traditions, and at last dies away, so far as the records and
traditions of humanity go, into a doubt and darkness as blank, just as
blank, as futurity.

And now let me remind you that this second zone of knowledge outside
the bright area of what we have felt and witnessed and handled for
ourselves--this zone of hearsay and history and tradition--completed the
whole knowledge of the past that was accessible to Shakespeare, for
example. To these limits man's knowledge of the past was absolutely
confined, save for some inklings and guesses, save for some small,
almost negligible beginnings, until the nineteenth century began.
Besides the correct knowledge in this scheme of hearsay and history
a man had a certain amount of legend and error that rounded off the
picture in a very satisfactory and misleading way, according to Bishop
Ussher, just exactly 4004 years B.C. And that was man's universal
history--that was his all--until the scientific epoch began. And beyond
those limits--? Well, I suppose the educated man of the sixteenth
century was as certain of the non-existence of anything before the
creation of the world as he was, and as most of us are still, of
the practical non-existence of the future, or at any rate he was as
satisfied of the impossibility of knowledge in the one direction as in
the other.
",discovery_future,wells,1913,0,1183
"
But modern science, that is to say the relentless systematic criticism
of phenomena, has in the past hundred years absolutely destroyed the
conception of a finitely distant beginning of things; has abolished such
limits to the past as a dated creation set, and added an enormous vista
to that limited sixteenth century outlook. And what I would insist upon
is that this further knowledge is a new kind of knowledge, obtained in
a new kind of way. We know to-day, quite as confidently and in many
respects more intimately than we know Sargon or Zenobia or Caractacus,
the form and the habits of creatures that no living being has ever met,
that no human eye has ever regarded, and the character of scenery that
no man has ever seen or can ever possibly see; we picture to ourselves
the labyrinthodon raising its clumsy head above the water of the
carboniferous swamps in which he lived, and we figure the pterodactyls,
those great bird lizards, flapping their way athwart the forests of
the Mesozoic age with exactly the same certainty as that with which we
picture the rhinoceros or the vulture. I doubt no more about the facts
in this farther picture than I do about those in the nearest. I believe
in the megatherium which I have never seen as confidently as I believe
in the hippopotamus that has engulfed buns from my hand. A vast amount
of detail in that farther picture is now fixed and finite for all time.
And a countless number of investigators are persistently and confidently
enlarging, amplifying, correcting, and pushing farther and farther
back the boundaries of this greater past--this prehuman past--that the
scientific criticism of existing phenomena has discovered and restored
and brought for the first time into the world of human thought. We have
become possessed of a new and once unsuspected history of the world--of
which all the history that was known, for example, to Dr. Johnson is
only the brief concluding chapter; and even that concluding chapter
has been greatly enlarged and corrected by the exploring archæologists
working strictly upon the lines of the new method--that is to say, the
comparison and criticism of suggestive facts.

I want particularly to insist upon this, that all this outer past--this
non-historical past--is the product of a new and keener habit of
inquiry, and no sort of revelation. It is simply due to a new and more
critical way of looking at things. Our knowledge of the geological past,
clear and definite as it has become, is of a different and lower order
than the knowledge of our memory, and yet of a quite practicable and
trustworthy order--a knowledge good enough to go upon; and if one were
to speak of the private memory as the personal past, of the next wider
area of knowledge as the traditional or historical past, then one might
call all that great and inspiring background of remoter geological time
the inductive past.

And this great discovery of the inductive past was got by the discussion
and rediscussion and effective criticism of a number of existing
facts, odd-shaped lumps of stone, streaks and bandings in quarries
and cliffs, anatomical and developmental detail that had always been
about in the world, that had been lying at the feet of mankind so long
as mankind had existed, but that no one had ever dreamed before could
supply any information at all, much more reveal such astounding and
enlightening vistas. Looked at in a new way they became sources of
dazzling and penetrating light. The remoter past lit up and became a
picture. Considered as effects, compared and criticised, they yielded a
clairvoyant vision of the history of interminable years.

And now, if it has been possible for men by picking out a number of
suggestive and significant looking things in the present, by comparing
them, criticising them, and discussing them, with a perpetual insistence
upon ""Why?"" without any guiding tradition, and indeed in the teeth of
established beliefs, to construct this amazing searchlight of inference
into the remoter past, is it really, after all, such an extravagant and
hopeless thing to suggest that, by seeking for operating causes instead
of for fossils, and by criticising them as persistently and thoroughly
as the geological record has been criticised, it may be possible to
throw a searchlight of inference forward instead of backward, and
to attain to a knowledge of coming things as clear, as universally
convincing, and infinitely more important to mankind than the clear
vision of the past that geology has opened to us during the nineteenth
century?

Let us grant that anything to correspond with the memory, anything
having the same relation to the future that memory has to the past,
is out of the question. We cannot imagine, of course, that we can
ever know any personal future to correspond with our personal past, or
any traditional future to correspond with our traditional past; but
the possibility of an inductive future to correspond with that great
inductive past of geology and archæology is an altogether different
thing.

I must confess that I believe quite firmly that an inductive knowledge
of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human
possibility. I believe that the time is drawing near when it will be
possible to suggest a systematic exploration of the future. And you must
not judge the practicability of this enterprise by the failures of the
past. So far nothing has been attempted, so far no first-class mind has
ever focused itself upon these issues; but suppose the laws of social
and political development, for example, were given as many brains, were
given as much attention, criticism, and discussion as we have given to
the laws of chemical combination during the last fifty years, what
might we not expect?

To the popular mind of to-day there is something very difficult in such
a suggestion, soberly made. But here, in this institution (the Royal
Institution of London) which has watched for a whole century over the
splendid adolescence of science, and where the spirit of science is
surely understood, you will know that as a matter of fact prophecy has
always been inseparably associated with the idea of scientific research.
",discovery_future,wells,1913,0,1044
"
The popular idea of scientific investigation is a vehement, aimless
collection of little facts, collected as a bower bird collects shells
and pebbles, in methodical little rows, and out of this process, in
some manner unknown to the popular mind, certain conjuring tricks--the
celebrated ""wonders of science""--in a sort of accidental way emerge.
The popular conception of all discovery is accident. But you will know
that the essential thing in the scientific process is not the collection
of facts, but the analysis of facts. Facts are the raw material and not
the substance of science. It is analysis that has given us all ordered
knowledge, and you know that the aim and the test and the justification
of the scientific process is not a marketable conjuring trick, but
prophecy. Until a scientific theory yields confident forecasts you
know it is unsound and tentative; it is mere theorizing, as evanescent
as art talk or the phantoms politicians talk about. The splendid body
of gravitational astronomy, for example, establishes itself upon
the certain forecast of stellar movements, and you would absolutely
refuse to believe its amazing assertions if it were not for these same
unerring forecasts. The whole body of medical science aims, and claims
the ability, to diagnose. Meteorology constantly and persistently aims
at prophecy, and it will never stand in a place of honor until it can
certainly foretell. The chemist forecasts elements before he meets
them--it is very properly his boast--and the splendid manner in which
the mind of Clerk Maxwell reached in front of all experiments and
foretold those things that Marconi has materialized is familiar to us
all.

All applied mathematics resolves into computation to foretell things
which otherwise can only be determined by trial. Even in so unscientific
a science as economics there have been forecasts. And if I am right in
saying that science aims at prophecy, and if the specialist in each
science is in fact doing his best now to prophesy within the limits of
his field, what is there to stand in the way of our building up this
growing body of forecast into an ordered picture of the future that
will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as
detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last hundred
years of the geological past? Well, so far and until we bring the
prophecy down to the affairs of man and his children, it is just as
possible to carry induction forward as back; it is just as simple and
sure to work out the changing orbit of the earth in the future until
the tidal drag hauls one unchanging face at last toward the sun as it
is to work back to its blazing and molten past. Until man comes in,
the inductive future is as real and convincing as the inductive past.
But inorganic forces are the smaller part and the minor interest in
this concern. Directly man becomes a factor the nature of the problem
changes, and our whole present interest centers on the question whether
man is, indeed, individually and collectively incalculable, a new
element which entirely alters the nature of our inquiry and stamps it at
once as vain and hopeless, or whether his presence complicates, but does
not alter, the essential nature of the induction. How far may we hope
to get trustworthy inductions about the future of man?

Well, I think, on the whole, we are inclined to underrate our chance
of certainties in the future, just as I think we are inclined to be
too credulous about the historical past. The vividness of our personal
memories, which are the very essence of reality to us, throws a glamor
of conviction over tradition and past inductions. But the personal
future must in the very nature of things be hidden from us so long as
time endures, and this black ignorance at our very feet--this black
shadow that corresponds to the brightness of our memories behind
us--throws a glamor of uncertainty and unreality over all the future. We
are continually surprising ourselves by our own will or want of will;
the individualities about us are continually producing the unexpected,
and it is very natural to reason that as we can never be precisely sure
before the time comes what we are going to do and feel, and if we can
never count with absolute certainty upon the acts and happenings even
of our most intimate friends, how much the more impossible is it to
anticipate the behavior in any direction of states and communities.


In reply to which I would advance the suggestion that an increase in
the number of human beings considered may positively simplify the
case instead of complicating it; that as the individuals increase in
number they begin to average out. Let me illustrate this point by a
comparison. Angular pit-sand has grains of the most varied shapes.
Examined microscopically, you will find all sorts of angles and outlines
and variations. Before you look you can say of no particular grain what
its outline will be. And if you shoot a load of such sand from a cart
you cannot foretell with any certainty where any particular grain will
be in the heap that you make; but you can tell--you can tell pretty
definitely--the form of the heap as a whole. And further, if you pass
that sand through a series of shoots and finally drop it some distance
to the ground, you will be able to foretell that grains of a certain
sort of form and size will for the most part be found in one part of
the heap and grains of another sort of form and size will be found in
another part of the heap. In such a case, you see, the thing as a whole
may be simpler than its component parts, and this I submit is also
the case in many human affairs. So that because the individual future
eludes us completely that is no reason why we should not aspire to, and
discover and use, safe and serviceable, generalizations upon countless
important issues in the human destiny.
",discovery_future,wells,1913,0,1028
"
But there is a very grave and important-looking difference between a
load of sand and a multitude of human beings, and this I must face
and examine. Our thoughts and wills and emotions are contagious. An
exceptional sort of sand grain, a sand grain that was exceptionally
big and heavy, for example, exerts no influence worth considering upon
any other of the sand grains in the load. They will fall and roll and
heap themselves just the same whether that exceptional grain is with
them or not; but an exceptional man comes into the world, a Cæsar or a
Napoleon or a Peter the Hermit, and he appears to persuade and convince
and compel and take entire possession of the sand heap--I mean the
community--and to twist and alter its destinies to an almost unlimited
extent. And if this is indeed the case, it reduces our project of an
inductive knowledge of the future to very small limits. To hope to
foretell the birth and coming of men of exceptional force and genius is
to hope incredibly, and if, indeed, such exceptional men do as much as
they seem to do in warping the path of humanity, our utmost prophetic
limit in human affairs is a conditional sort of prophecy. If people do
so and so, we can say, then such and such results will follow, and we
must admit that that is our limit.

But everybody does not believe in the importance of the leading man.
There are those who will say that the whole world is different by reason
of Napoleon. There are those who will say that the world of to-day
would be very much as it is now if Napoleon had never been born. Other
men would have arisen to make Napoleon's conquests and codify the law,
redistribute the worn-out boundaries of Europe and achieve all those
changes which we so readily ascribe to Napoleon's will alone. There are
those who believe entirely in the individual man and those who believe
entirely in the forces behind the individual man, and for my own part
I must confess myself a rather extreme case of the latter kind. I must
confess I believe that if by some juggling with space and time Julius
Cæsar, Napoleon, Edward IV., William the Conqueror, Lord Rosebery, and
Robert Burns had all been changed at birth it would not have produced
any serious dislocation of the course of destiny. I believe that these
great men of ours are no more than images and symbols and instruments
taken, as it were, haphazard by the incessant and consistent forces
behind them; they are the pen-nibs Fate has used for her writing, the
diamonds upon the drill that pierces through the rock. And the more
one inclines to this trust in forces the more one will believe in the
possibility of a reasoned inductive view of the future that will serve
us in politics, in morals, in social contrivances, and in a thousand
spacious ways. And even those who take the most extreme and personal
and melodramatic view of the ways of human destiny, who see life as a
tissue of fairy godmother births and accidental meetings and promises
and jealousies, will, I suppose, admit there comes a limit to these
things--that at last personality dies away and the greater forces come
to their own. The great man, however great he be, cannot set back the
whole scheme of things; what he does in right and reason will remain,
and what he does against the greater creative forces will perish. We
cannot foresee him; let us grant that. His personal difference, the
splendor of his effect, his dramatic arrangement of events will be his
own--in other words, we cannot estimate for accidents and accelerations
and delays; but if only we throw our web of generalization wide enough,
if only we spin our rope of induction strong enough, the final result of
the great man, his ultimate surviving consequences, will come within our
net.

Such, then, is the sort of knowledge of the future that I believe is
attainable and worth attaining. I believe that the deliberate direction
of historical study and of economic and social study toward the future
and an increasing reference, a deliberate and courageous reference,
to the future in moral and religious discussion, would be enormously
stimulating and enormously profitable to our intellectual life. I have
done my best to suggest to you that such an enterprise is now a serious
and practicable undertaking. But at the risk of repetition I would call
your attention to the essential difference that must always hold between
our attainable knowledge of the future and our existing knowledge of the
past. The portion of the past that is brightest and most real to each
of us is the individual past--the personal memory. The portion of the
future that must remain darkest and least accessible is the individual
future. Scientific prophecy will not be fortune-telling, whatever else
it may be. Those excellent people who cast horoscopes, those illegal
fashionable palm-reading ladies who abound so much to-day, in whom
nobody is so foolish as to believe, and to whom everybody is foolish
enough to go, need fear no competition from the scientific prophets.
The knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not
individual; it will be no sort of knowledge that will either hamper
us in the exercise of our individual free will or relieve us of our
personal responsibility.

And now, how far is it possible at the present time to speculate on the
particular outline the future will assume when it is investigated in
this way?

It is interesting, before we answer that question, to take into account
the speculations of a certain sect and culture of people who already,
before the middle of last century, had set their faces toward the
future as the justifying explanation of the present. These were the
positivists, whose position is still most eloquently maintained and
displayed by Mr. Frederic Harrison, in spite of the great expansion of
the human outlook that has occurred since Comte.

Mr. Bedford Meets Mr. Cavor at Lympne

As I sit down to write here amidst the shadows of vine-leaves under the
blue sky of southern Italy, it comes to me with a certain quality of
astonishment that my participation in these amazing adventures of Mr.
Cavor was, after all, the outcome of the purest accident. It might have
been any one. I fell into these things at a time when I thought myself
removed from the slightest possibility of disturbing experiences. I had
gone to Lympne because I had imagined it the most uneventful place in the
world. ""Here, at any rate,"" said I, ""I shall find peace and a chance to
work!""

And this book is the sequel. So utterly at variance is destiny with all
the little plans of men. I may perhaps mention here that very recently I
had come an ugly cropper in certain business enterprises. Sitting now
surrounded by all the circumstances of wealth, there is a luxury in
admitting my extremity. I can admit, even, that to a certain extent my
disasters were conceivably of my own making. It may be there are
directions in which I have some capacity, but the conduct of business
operations is not among these. But in those days I was young, and my youth
among other objectionable forms took that of a pride in my capacity for
affairs. I am young still in years, but the things that have happened to
me have rubbed something of the youth from my mind. Whether they have
brought any wisdom to light below it is a more doubtful matter.

It is scarcely necessary to go into the details of the speculations that
landed me at Lympne, in Kent. Nowadays even about business transactions
there is a strong spice of adventure. I took risks. In these things
there is invariably a certain amount of give and take, and it fell to me
finally to do the giving reluctantly enough. Even when I had got out of
everything, one cantankerous creditor saw fit to be malignant. Perhaps you
have met that flaming sense of outraged virtue, or perhaps you have only
felt it. He ran me hard. It seemed to me, at last, that there was nothing
for it but to write a play, unless I wanted to drudge for my living as a
clerk. I have a certain imagination, and luxurious tastes, and I meant to
make a vigorous fight for it before that fate overtook me. In addition to
my belief in my powers as a business man, I had always in those days had
an idea that I was equal to writing a very good play. It is not, I
believe, a very uncommon persuasion. I knew there is nothing a man can do
outside legitimate business transactions that has such opulent
possibilities, and very probably that biased my opinion. I had, indeed,
got into the habit of regarding this unwritten drama as a convenient
little reserve put by for a rainy day. That rainy day had come, and I set
to work.

I soon discovered that writing a play was a longer business than I had
supposed; at first I had reckoned ten days for it, and it was to have a
pied-a-terre while it was in hand that I came to Lympne. I reckoned myself
lucky in getting that little bungalow. I got it on a three years'
agreement. I put in a few sticks of furniture, and while the play was in
hand I did my own cooking. My cooking would have shocked Mrs. Bond. And
yet, you know, it had flavour. I had a coffee-pot, a sauce-pan for eggs,
and one for potatoes, and a frying-pan for sausages and bacon--such was
the simple apparatus of my comfort. One cannot always be magnificent, but
simplicity is always a possible alternative. For the rest I laid in an
eighteen-gallon cask of beer on credit, and a trustful baker came each
day. It was not, perhaps, in the style of Sybaris, but I have had worse
times. I was a little sorry for the baker, who was a very decent man
indeed, but even for him I hoped.

Certainly if any one wants solitude, the place is Lympne. It is in the
clay part of Kent, and my bungalow stood on the edge of an old sea cliff
and stared across the flats of Romney Marsh at the sea. In very wet
weather the place is almost inaccessible, and I have heard that at times
the postman used to traverse the more succulent portions of his route with
boards upon his feet. I never saw him doing so, but I can quite imagine
it. Outside the doors of the few cottages and houses that make up the
present village big birch besoms are stuck, to wipe off the worst of the
clay, which will give some idea of the texture of the district. I doubt if
the place would be there at all, if it were not a fading memory of things
gone for ever. It was the big port of England in Roman times, Portus
Lemanis, and now the sea is four miles away. All down the steep hill are
boulders and masses of Roman brickwork, and from it old Watling Street,
still paved in places, starts like an arrow to the north. I used to stand
on the hill and think of it all, the galleys and legions, the captives and
officials, the women and traders, the speculators like myself, all the
swarm and tumult that came clanking in and out of the harbour. And now
just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slope, and a sheep or two--and I.
And where the port had been were the levels of the marsh, sweeping round
in a broad curve to distant Dungeness, and dotted here and there with tree
clumps and the church towers of old medieval towns that are following
Lemanis now towards extinction.

That outlook on the marsh was, indeed, one of the finest views I have ever
seen. I suppose Dungeness was fifteen miles away; it lay like a raft on
the sea, and farther westward were the hills by Hastings under the setting
sun. Sometimes they hung close and clear, sometimes they were faded and
low, and often the drift of the weather took them clean out of sight. And
all the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit by ditches and
canals.

The window at which I worked looked over the skyline of this crest, and it
was from this window that I first set eyes on Cavor. It was just as I was
struggling with my scenario, holding down my mind to the sheer hard work
of it, and naturally enough he arrested my attention.

The sun had set, the sky was a vivid tranquillity of green and yellow, and
against that he came out black--the oddest little figure.

He was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little man, with a jerky quality
in his motions; he had seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a
cricket cap, an overcoat, and cycling knickerbockers and stockings. Why he
did so I do not know, for he never cycled and he never played cricket. It
was a fortuitous concurrence of garments, arising I know not how. He
gesticulated with his hands and arms, and jerked his head about and
buzzed. He buzzed like something electric. You never heard such buzzing.
And ever and again he cleared his throat with a most extraordinary noise.
",moon_men,wells,1901,1,1262
"
There had been rain, and that spasmodic walk of his was enhanced by the
extreme slipperiness of the footpath. Exactly as he came against the sun
he stopped, pulled out a watch, hesitated. Then with a sort of convulsive
gesture he turned and retreated with every manifestation of haste, no
longer gesticulating, but going with ample strides that showed the
relatively large size of his feet--they were, I remember, grotesquely
exaggerated in size by adhesive clay--to the best possible advantage.

This occurred on the first day of my sojourn, when my play-writing energy
was at its height and I regarded the incident simply as an annoying
distraction--the waste of five minutes. I returned to my scenario. But
when next evening the apparition was repeated with remarkable precision,
and again the next evening, and indeed every evening when rain was not
falling, concentration upon the scenario became a considerable effort.
""Confound the man,"" I said, ""one would think he was learning to be a
marionette!"" and for several evenings I cursed him pretty heartily. Then
my annoyance gave way to amazement and curiosity. Why on earth should a
man do this thing? On the fourteenth evening I could stand it no longer,
and so soon as he appeared I opened the french window, crossed the
verandah, and directed myself to the point where he invariably stopped.

He had his watch out as I came up to him. He had a chubby, rubicund face
with reddish brown eyes--previously I had seen him only against the
light. ""One moment, sir,"" said I as he turned. He stared. ""One moment,""
he said, ""certainly. Or if you wish to speak to me for longer, and it is
not asking too much--your moment is up--would it trouble you to
accompany me?""

""Not in the least,"" said I, placing myself beside him.

""My habits are regular. My time for intercourse--limited.""

""This, I presume, is your time for exercise?""

""It is. I come here to enjoy the sunset.""

""You don't.""

""Sir?""

""You never look at it.""

""Never look at it?""

""No. I've watched you thirteen nights, and not once have you looked at the
sunset--not once.""

He knitted his brows like one who encounters a problem.

""Well, I enjoy the sunlight--the atmosphere--I go along this path,
through that gate""--he jerked his head over his shoulder--""and round--""

""You don't. You never have been. It's all nonsense. There isn't a way.
To-night for instance--""

""Oh! to-night! Let me see. Ah! I just glanced at my watch, saw that I had
already been out just three minutes over the precise half-hour, decided
there was not time to go round, turned--""

""You always do.""

He looked at me--reflected. ""Perhaps I do, now I come to think of it. But
what was it you wanted to speak to me about?""

""Why, this!""

""This?""

""Yes. Why do you do it? Every night you come making a noise--""

""Making a noise?""

""Like this."" I imitated his buzzing noise. He looked at me, and it was
evident the buzzing awakened distaste. ""Do I do that?"" he asked.

""Every blessed evening.""

""I had no idea.""

He stopped dead. He regarded me gravely. ""Can it be,"" he said, ""that I
have formed a Habit?""

""Well, it looks like it. Doesn't it?""

He pulled down his lower lip between finger and thumb. He regarded a
puddle at his feet.

""My mind is much occupied,"" he said. ""And you want to know why! Well, sir,
I can assure you that not only do I not know why I do these things, but I
did not even know I did them. Come to think, it is just as you say;
I never _have_ been beyond that field.... And these things annoy you?""

For some reason I was beginning to relent towards him. ""Not annoy,""
I said. ""But--imagine yourself writing a play!""

""I couldn't.""

""Well, anything that needs concentration.""

""Ah!"" he said, ""of course,"" and meditated. His expression became so
eloquent of distress, that I relented still more. After all, there is a
touch of aggression in demanding of a man you don't know why he hums on
a public footpath.

""You see,"" he said weakly, ""it's a habit.""

""Oh, I recognise that.""

""I must stop it.""

""But not if it puts you out. After all, I had no business--it's something
of a liberty.""

""Not at all, sir,"" he said, ""not at all. I am greatly indebted to you. I
should guard myself against these things. In future I will. Could I
trouble you--once again? That noise?""

""Something like this,"" I said. ""Zuzzoo, zuzzoo. But really, you know--""

""I am greatly obliged to you. In fact, I know I am getting absurdly
absent-minded. You are quite justified, sir--perfectly justified. Indeed,
I am indebted to you. The thing shall end. And now, sir, I have already
brought you farther than I should have done.""

""I do hope my impertinence--""

""Not at all, sir, not at all.""

We regarded each other for a moment. I raised my hat and wished him a good
evening. He responded convulsively, and so we went our ways.

At the stile I looked back at his receding figure. His bearing had changed
remarkably, he seemed limp, shrunken. The contrast with his former
gesticulating, zuzzoing self took me in some absurd way as pathetic. I
watched him out of sight. Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own
business, I returned to my bungalow and my play.

The next evening I saw nothing of him, nor the next. But he was very much
in my mind, and it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic
character he might serve a useful purpose in the development of my plot.
The third day he called upon me.

For a time I was puzzled to think what had brought him. He made
indifferent conversation in the most formal way, then abruptly he came to
business. He wanted to buy me out of my bungalow.

""You see,"" he said, ""I don't blame you in the least, but you've
destroyed a habit, and it disorganises my day. I've walked past here for
years--years. No doubt I've hummed.... You've made all that impossible!""

I suggested he might try some other direction.

""No. There is no other direction. This is the only one. I've inquired.
And now--every afternoon at four--I come to a dead wall.""

""But, my dear sir, if the thing is so important to you--""

""It's vital. You see, I'm--I'm an investigator--I am engaged in a
scientific research. I live--"" he paused and seemed to think. ""Just over
there,"" he said, and pointed suddenly dangerously near my eye. ""The house
with white chimneys you see just over the trees. And my circumstances are
abnormal--abnormal. I am on the point of completing one of the most
important--demonstrations--I can assure you one of the most important
demonstrations that have ever been made. It requires constant thought,
constant mental ease and activity. And the afternoon was my brightest
time!--effervescing with new ideas--new points of view.""

""But why not come by still?""

""It would be all different. I should be self-conscious. I should think of
you at your play--watching me irritated--instead of thinking of my work.
No! I must have the bungalow.""
",moon_men,wells,1901,1,1207
"
I meditated. Naturally, I wanted to think the matter over thoroughly
before anything decisive was said. I was generally ready enough for
business in those days, and selling always attracted me; but in the first
place it was not my bungalow, and even if I sold it to him at a good price
I might get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods if the current owner
got wind of the transaction, and in the second I was, well--undischarged.
It was clearly a business that required delicate handling. Moreover,
the possibility of his being in pursuit of some valuable invention also
interested me. It occurred to me that I would like to know more of this
research, not with any dishonest intention, but simply with an idea
that to know what it was would be a relief from play-writing. I threw
out feelers.

He was quite willing to supply information. Indeed, once he was fairly
under way the conversation became a monologue. He talked like a man long
pent up, who has had it over with himself again and again. He talked for
nearly an hour, and I must confess I found it a pretty stiff bit of
listening. But through it all there was the undertone of satisfaction one
feels when one is neglecting work one has set oneself. During that first
interview I gathered very little of the drift of his work. Half his words
were technicalities entirely strange to me, and he illustrated one or two
points with what he was pleased to call elementary mathematics, computing
on an envelope with a copying-ink pencil, in a manner that made it hard
even to seem to understand. ""Yes,"" I said, ""yes. Go on!"" Nevertheless I
made out enough to convince me that he was no mere crank playing at
discoveries. In spite of his crank-like appearance there was a force about
him that made that impossible. Whatever it was, it was a thing with
mechanical possibilities. He told me of a work-shed he had, and of three
assistants--originally jobbing carpenters--whom he had trained. Now,
from the work-shed to the patent office is clearly only one step. He
invited me to see those things. I accepted readily, and took care, by a
remark or so, to underline that. The proposed transfer of the bungalow
remained very conveniently in suspense.

At last he rose to depart, with an apology for the length of his call.
Talking over his work was, he said, a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely. It
was not often he found such an intelligent listener as myself, he mingled
very little with professional scientific men.

""So much pettiness,"" he explained; ""so much intrigue! And really, when one
has an idea--a novel, fertilising idea--I don't want to be uncharitable,
but--""

I am a man who believes in impulses. I made what was perhaps a rash
proposition. But you must remember, that I had been alone, play-writing in
Lympne, for fourteen days, and my compunction for his ruined walk still
hung about me. ""Why not,"" said I, ""make this your new habit? In the place
of the one I spoilt? At least, until we can settle about the bungalow.
What you want is to turn over your work in your mind. That you have always
done during your afternoon walk. Unfortunately that's over--you can't get
things back as they were. But why not come and talk about your work to me;
use me as a sort of wall against which you may throw your thoughts and
catch them again? It's certain I don't know enough to steal your ideas
myself--and I know no scientific men--""

I stopped. He was considering. Evidently the thing, attracted him. ""But
I'm afraid I should bore you,"" he said.

""You think I'm too dull?""

""Oh, no; but technicalities--""

""Anyhow, you've interested me immensely this afternoon.""

""Of course it would be a great help to me. Nothing clears up one's ideas
so much as explaining them. Hitherto--""

""My dear sir, say no more.""

""But really can you spare the time?""

""There is no rest like change of occupation,"" I said, with profound
conviction.

The affair was over. On my verandah steps he turned. ""I am already greatly
indebted to you,"" he said.

I made an interrogative noise.

""You have completely cured me of that ridiculous habit of humming,"" he
explained.

I think I said I was glad to be of any service to him, and he turned away.

Immediately the train of thought that our conversation had suggested must
have resumed its sway. His arms began to wave in their former fashion.
The faint echo of ""zuzzoo"" came back to me on the breeze....

Well, after all, that was not my affair....

He came the next day, and again the next day after that, and delivered
two lectures on physics to our mutual satisfaction. He talked with an
air of being extremely lucid about the ""ether"" and ""tubes of force,"" and
""gravitational potential,"" and things like that, and I sat in my other
folding-chair and said, ""Yes,"" ""Go on,"" ""I follow you,"" to keep him
going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he ever
suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments when I
doubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was resting from
that confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly for a
space, only to vanish just when I thought I had hold of them. Sometimes my
attention failed altogether, and I would give it up and sit and stare at
him, wondering whether, after all, it would not be better to use him as a
central figure in a good farce and let all this other stuff slide. And
then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.

At the earliest opportunity I went to see his house. It was large and
carelessly furnished; there were no servants other than his three
assistants, and his dietary and private life were characterised by a
philosophical simplicity. He was a water-drinker, a vegetarian, and all
those logical disciplinary things. But the sight of his equipment settled
many doubts. It looked like business from cellar to attic--an amazing
little place to find in an out-of-the-way village. The ground-floor rooms
contained benches and apparatus, the bakehouse and scullery boiler had
developed into respectable furnaces, dynamos occupied the cellar, and
there was a gasometer in the garden. He showed it to me with all the
confiding zest of a man who has been living too much alone. His seclusion
was overflowing now in an excess of confidence, and I had the good luck to
be the recipient.

The three assistants were creditable specimens of the class of ""handy-men""
from which they came. Conscientious if unintelligent, strong, civil, and
willing. One, Spargus, who did the cooking and all the metal work, had
been a sailor; a second, Gibbs, was a joiner; and the third was an
ex-jobbing gardener, and now general assistant. They were the merest
labourers. All the intelligent work was done by Cavor. Theirs was the
darkest ignorance compared even with my muddled impression.

And now, as to the nature of these inquiries. Here, unhappily, comes a
grave difficulty. I am no scientific expert, and if I were to attempt to
set forth in the highly scientific language of Mr. Cavor the aim to which
his experiments tended, I am afraid I should confuse not only the reader
but myself, and almost certainly I should make some blunder that would
bring upon me the mockery of every up-to-date student of mathematical
physics in the country. The best thing I can do therefore is, I think to
give my impressions in my own inexact language, without any attempt to
wear a garment of knowledge to which I have no claim.
",moon_men,wells,1901,1,1307
"
The object of Mr. Cavor's search was a substance that should be
""opaque""--he used some other word I have forgotten, but ""opaque"" conveys
the idea--to ""all forms of radiant energy."" ""Radiant energy,"" he made me
understand, was anything like light or heat, or those Rontgen Rays there
was so much talk about a year or so ago, or the electric waves of Marconi,
or gravitation. All these things, he said, _radiate_ out from centres, and
act on bodies at a distance, whence comes the term ""radiant energy."" Now
almost all substances are opaque to some form or other of radiant energy.
Glass, for example, is transparent to light, but much less so to heat, so
that it is useful as a fire-screen; and alum is transparent to light, but
blocks heat completely. A solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, on the
other hand, completely blocks light, but is quite transparent to heat. It
will hide a fire from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you. Metals
are not only opaque to light and heat, but also to electrical energy,
which passes through both iodine solution and glass almost as though they
were not interposed. And so on.

Now all known substances are ""transparent"" to gravitation. You can use
screens of various sorts to cut off the light or heat, or electrical
influence of the sun, or the warmth of the earth from anything; you can
screen things by sheets of metal from Marconi's rays, but nothing will cut
off the gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravitational
attraction of the earth. Yet why there should be nothing is hard to say.
Cavor did not see why such a substance should not exist, and certainly I
could not tell him. I had never thought of such a possibility before. He
showed me by calculations on paper, which Lord Kelvin, no doubt, or
Professor Lodge, or Professor Karl Pearson, or any of those great
scientific people might have understood, but which simply reduced me to a
hopeless muddle, that not only was such a substance possible, but that it
must satisfy certain conditions. It was an amazing piece of reasoning.
Much as it amazed and exercised me at the time, it would be impossible to
reproduce it here. ""Yes,"" I said to it all, ""yes; go on!"" Suffice it for
this story that he believed he might be able to manufacture this possible
substance opaque to gravitation out of a complicated alloy of metals and
something new--a new element, I fancy--called, I believe, _helium_, which
was sent to him from London in sealed stone jars. Doubt has been thrown
upon this detail, but I am almost certain it was _helium_ he had sent him
in sealed stone jars. It was certainly something very gaseous and thin.
If only I had taken notes...

But then, how was I to foresee the necessity of taking notes?

Any one with the merest germ of an imagination will understand the
extraordinary possibilities of such a substance, and will sympathise a
little with the emotion I felt as this understanding emerged from the haze
of abstruse phrases in which Cavor expressed himself. Comic relief in a
play indeed! It was some time before I would believe that I had
interpreted him aright, and I was very careful not to ask questions that
would have enabled him to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding into
which he dropped his daily exposition. But no one reading the story of it
here will sympathise fully, because from my barren narrative it will be
impossible to gather the strength of my conviction that this astonishing
substance was positively going to be made.

I do not recall that I gave my play an hour's consecutive work at any time
after my visit to his house. My imagination had other things to do. There
seemed no limit to the possibilities of the stuff; whichever way I tried I
came on miracles and revolutions. For example, if one wanted to lift a
weight, however enormous, one had only to get a sheet of this substance
beneath it, and one might lift it with a straw. My first natural impulse
was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads, and all the material
and methods of war, and from that to shipping, locomotion, building, every
conceivable form of human industry. The chance that had brought me into
the very birth-chamber of this new time--it was an epoch, no less--was
one of those chances that come once in a thousand years. The thing
unrolled, it expanded and expanded. Among other things I saw in it my
redemption as a business man. I saw a parent company, and daughter
companies, applications to right of us, applications to left, rings and
trusts, privileges, and concessions spreading and spreading, until one
vast, stupendous Cavorite company ran and ruled the world.

And I was in it!

I took my line straight away. I knew I was staking everything, but I
jumped there and then.

""We're on absolutely the biggest thing that has ever been invented,"" I
said, and put the accent on ""we."" ""If you want to keep me out of this,
you'll have to do it with a gun. I'm coming down to be your fourth
labourer to-morrow.""

He seemed surprised at my enthusiasm, but not a bit suspicious or hostile.
Rather, he was self-depreciatory. He looked at me doubtfully. ""But do you
really think--?"" he said. ""And your play! How about that play?""

""It's vanished!"" I cried. ""My dear sir, don't you see what you've got?
Don't you see what you're going to do?""

That was merely a rhetorical turn, but positively, he didn't. At first I
could not believe it. He had not had the beginning of the inkling of an
idea. This astonishing little man had been working on purely theoretical
grounds the whole time! When he said it was ""the most important"" research
the world had ever seen, he simply meant it squared up so many theories,
settled so much that was in doubt; he had troubled no more about the
application of the stuff he was going to turn out than if he had been a
machine that makes guns. This was a possible substance, and he was going
to make it! V'la tout, as the Frenchman says.

Beyond that, he was childish! If he made it, it would go down to posterity
as Cavorite or Cavorine, and he would be made an F.R.S., and his portrait
given away as a scientific worthy with Nature, and things like that. And
that was all he saw! He would have dropped this bombshell into the world
as though he had discovered a new species of gnat, if it had not happened
that I had come along. And there it would have lain and fizzled, like one
or two other little things these scientific people have lit and dropped
about us.

When I realised this, it was I did the talking, and Cavor who said, ""Go
on!"" I jumped up. I paced the room, gesticulating like a boy of twenty.
I tried to make him understand his duties and responsibilities in the
matter--_our_ duties and responsibilities in the matter. I assured him we
might make wealth enough to work any sort of social revolution we fancied,
we might own and order the whole world. I told him of companies and
patents, and the case for secret processes. All these things seemed to
take him much as his mathematics had taken me. A look of perplexity came
into his ruddy little face. He stammered something about indifference to
wealth, but I brushed all that aside. He had got to be rich, and it was no
good his stammering. I gave him to understand the sort of man I was, and
that I had had very considerable business experience. I did not tell him
I was an undischarged bankrupt at the time, because that was temporary,
but I think I reconciled my evident poverty with my financial claims. And
quite insensibly, in the way such projects grow, the understanding of a
Cavorite monopoly grew up between us. He was to make the stuff, and I was
to make the boom.
",moon_men,wells,1901,1,1373
"
I stuck like a leech to the ""we""--""you"" and ""I"" didn't exist for me.

His idea was that the profits I spoke of might go to endow research, but
that, of course, was a matter we had to settle later. ""That's all right,""
I shouted, ""that's all right."" The great point, as I insisted, was to get
the thing done.

""Here is a substance,"" I cried, ""no home, no factory, no fortress, no ship
can dare to be without--more universally applicable even than a patent
medicine. There isn't a solitary aspect of it, not one of its ten thousand
possible uses that will not make us rich, Cavor, beyond the dreams of
avarice!""

""No!"" he said. ""I begin to see. It's extraordinary how one gets new points
of view by talking over things!""

""And as it happens you have just talked to the right man!""

""I suppose no one,"" he said, ""is absolutely _averse_ to enormous wealth.
Of course there is one thing--""

He paused. I stood still.

""It is just possible, you know, that we may not be able to make it after
all! It may be one of those things that are a theoretical possibility, but
a practical absurdity. Or when we make it, there may be some little
hitch!""

""We'll tackle the hitch when it comes."" said I.





The First Making of Cavorite

But Cavor's fears were groundless, so far as the actual making was
concerned. On the 14th of October, 1899, this incredible substance was
made!

Oddly enough, it was made at last by accident, when Mr. Cavor least
expected it. He had fused together a number of metals and certain other
things--I wish I knew the particulars now!--and he intended to leave
the mixture a week and then allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had
miscalculated, the last stage in the combination would occur when the
stuff sank to a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. But it chanced
that, unknown to Cavor, dissension had arisen about the furnace tending.
Gibbs, who had previously seen to this, had suddenly attempted to shift
it to the man who had been a gardener, on the score that coal was soil,
being dug, and therefore could not possibly fall within the province of
a joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener alleged, however, that
coal was a metallic or ore-like substance, let alone that he was cook.
But Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing that he was a
joiner and that coal is notoriously fossil wood. Consequently Gibbs
ceased to replenish the furnace, and no one else did so, and Cavor was
too much immersed in certain interesting problems concerning a Cavorite
flying machine (neglecting the resistance of the air and one or two
other points) to perceive that anything was wrong. And the premature
birth of his invention took place just as he was coming across the field
to my bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea.

I remember the occasion with extreme vividness. The water was boiling, and
everything was prepared, and the sound of his ""zuzzoo"" had brought me out
upon the verandah. His active little figure was black against the autumnal
sunset, and to the right the chimneys of his house just rose above a
gloriously tinted group of trees. Remoter rose the Wealden Hills, faint
and blue, while to the left the hazy marsh spread out spacious and serene.
And then--

The chimneys jerked heavenward, smashing into a string of bricks as they
rose, and the roof and a miscellany of furniture followed. Then overtaking
them came a huge white flame. The trees about the building swayed and
whirled and tore themselves to pieces, that sprang towards the flare. My
ears were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me deaf on one side for
life, and all about me windows smashed, unheeded.

I took three steps from the verandah towards Cavor's house, and even as I
did so came the wind.

Instantly my coat tails were over my head, and I was progressing in great
leaps and bounds, and quite against my will, towards him. In the same
moment the discoverer was seized, whirled about, and flew through the
screaming air. I saw one of my chimney pots hit the ground within six
yards of me, leap a score of feet, and so hurry in great strides towards
the focus of the disturbance. Cavor, kicking and flapping, came down
again, rolled over and over on the ground for a space, struggled up and
was lifted and borne forward at an enormous velocity, vanishing at last
among the labouring, lashing trees that writhed about his house.

A mass of smoke and ashes, and a square of bluish shining substance rushed
up towards the zenith. A large fragment of fencing came sailing past me,
dropped edgeways, hit the ground and fell flat, and then the worst was
over. The aerial commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere strong gale,
and I became once more aware that I had breath and feet. By leaning back
against the wind I managed to stop, and could collect such wits as still
remained to me.

In that instant the whole face of the world had changed. The tranquil
sunset had vanished, the sky was dark with scurrying clouds, everything
was flattened and swaying with the gale. I glanced back to see if my
bungalow was still in a general way standing, then staggered forwards
towards the trees amongst which Cavor had vanished, and through whose tall
and leaf-denuded branches shone the flames of his burning house.

I entered the copse, dashing from one tree to another and clinging to
them, and for a space I sought him in vain. Then amidst a heap of smashed
branches and fencing that had banked itself against a portion of his
garden wall I perceived something stir. I made a run for this, but before
I reached it a brown object separated itself, rose on two muddy legs, and
protruded two drooping, bleeding hands. Some tattered ends of garment
fluttered out from its middle portion and streamed before the wind.

For a moment I did not recognise this earthy lump, and then I saw that it
was Cavor, caked in the mud in which he had rolled. He leant forward
against the wind, rubbing the dirt from his eyes and mouth.

He extended a muddy lump of hand, and staggered a pace towards me. His
face worked with emotion, little lumps of mud kept falling from it. He
looked as damaged and pitiful as any living creature I have ever seen, and
his remark therefore amazed me exceedingly.

""Gratulate me,"" he gasped; ""gratulate me!""

""Congratulate you!"" said I. ""Good heavens! What for?""

""I've done it.""

""You _have_. What on earth caused that explosion?""

A gust of wind blew his words away. I understood him to say that it wasn't
an explosion at all. The wind hurled me into collision with him, and we
stood clinging to one another.

""Try and get back--to my bungalow,"" I bawled in his ear. He did not hear
me, and shouted something about ""three martyrs--science,"" and also
something about ""not much good."" At the time he laboured under the
impression that his three attendants had perished in the whirlwind.
Happily this was incorrect. Directly he had left for my bungalow they had
gone off to the public-house in Lympne to discuss the question of the
furnaces over some trivial refreshment.
